I’m sure it has nothing to do with the battle in the lottery, but in all seriousness I hope he has a healthy and full recovery 
Would be a pretty big hit if we lose schroder for good, since that just means that we have to fill in our PG spot for our upcoming dynasty with Ayton, Prince, Collins.
depending on how this felony trial shakes out I could definitely see us waiving him, and even if he gets off scott free, he could very well be traded. will be interesting to see how Shlenk handles it.
Not a chance in the world he gets waived, we might trade him for cheap but we're not waiving a player of his level at his age lol
well if he gets convicted of a felony and goes to prison we would waive him in that case

I doubt he will go to prison, but that’s certainly a possibility
it honestly depends on how the trial goes, the team said they are waiting for the court's decision before taking disciplinary action. it's starting to sound like the beating was more severe and Dennis was more involved than previously known.
Honestly it could even turn out to be a good thing. I know Dennis is awesome and all, but the hawks already had 27 million in cap space. 

They could be a nuisance in RFA and a player in unrestricted free agency if Schroder's 18 million comes off the books. 
I 'll reevaluate the situation after the draft. If we get a good prospect at the PG position with Twolves pick, I am fine. 
Dang this man is so smooth. I love Ayton but its such a toss up.
We better start praying to the ping pong ball gods now
We need a ping pong god bot to make us have a higher chance of winning 
How many kids do we sacrifice?
Ghetto style tank watch was like a signature for you. I think you should bring it back. 

Orlando gets the win today btw, so WE GUCCI!
haha it did have a certain charm
> Orlando

> win

Choose 1 
Rofl! Fair enough. 
The Hawks really struck it rich with that John Collins guy. A 6' 10" 20-year-old from Wake Forest who also studied origami for 10 years and holds the world record for longest distance achieved by a paper airplane.
better nickname then the baptist tbh
I was there and wish like hell I’d taken video of it. But I was too hyped at the moment. Best basketball experience of my life. 
Good energy that year… I miss that guy.
How about one more ladies and gentleman? 
As a Sixers fan I sure hope you guys tank hard tonight and the rest of the way.   Get yourself a top pick and a star.  


The Gods taking their price for that Super Bowl
Well, I guess Simmons played a lot of PUBG yesterday. I hope we win both games and our wins are costly enough for them to get their ass kicked by the Cavs in the first round. YOU DON'T DIS ATL, KID. 
Pretty interested to see how Ben is without Joel
Glad you stayed a fan of the local teams Pat
No one should be heated enough over that comment (which was funny and true) to want to derail the tank. The wins would be way more costly for us. The ultimate revenge is out-processing them. 
Thergood, why don't you focus on one thing at a time. Simmons will be fine, tanking is what's important now.
Update: He good
lol i got two monitors dont stress it
My friend’s dad is a huge 6ers fan that lives OTP and was happy to see us play them tonight at home, but then Embiid had to break his face....so now he will enjoy Taurean “The Tank Commander” (Clutch Shooter) Prince raining down deep threes all night long baby
injury wise or jail wise?
I rock 14 because I was born on the 14 but also when 14 is available I go with 44 for Pistol Pete
I'm right there with you, man. I haven't seen another living person on my college campus all day. Everyone is gone.
My life is great guy

Gonna be shitposting from a flip phone, catch y’all on the dark side of the moon
Sex life wise
I was born on the 23rd but I don't want to be caught looking like some guy who believes there are only two good basketball players in history, them being MJ and Lebron.
I'm not 23 material. The best I can do is pass like Jason Williams every once in a while and throw up a consistent floater to go with a three here and there.
I love Sap man
Him and I still miss Horford. Good dudes that played hard.
Always been a standup guy, I agree you gotta wish the best for a guy that plays and leads the way Paul does. Before his injury I found myself rooting for the Nuggets sometimes 😅
They're just so easy to pull for! Gary Harris, jokic, jamal Murray, they even have a plumlee 
Much appreciated!
k I'll try that for tomorrow. It also looked fine when I did it from home (with RES preview) but was fudged when I finished it at work. I'll probably just prep it tonight and fill in the blanks in the morning from home to make it look nice again.
Welcome!
this thread will go great i'm sure
Has that happened before?
  
I'm asking...for a friend. He wants to know if there was actual time travel and if it factors into the Hawkspiracy lol whatever that is he's a loon.
[I can only find my part of it right now](https://www.reddit.com/r/AtlantaHawks/comments/6ppaok/congratulations_to_john_the_cyborgbaptist_collins/) but yeah we traveled all through space and time for a good 8-9 days
He is a basketball player, that's for certain
very impressive how he's kept his percentages up with the increased workload. that's what catches my attention
He's like ok I guess
Hot take
I can't see why that would happen. Not like they wouldn't be able to play together, or that we would put more stock in a rookie that didn't play in college over a proven NBA player
It wouldn’t happen right away, but eventually. 

Also I wasn’t serious lol
We are projected to win two more games. I picked the games I want us to win the most. 
Man can we just lose out with Dedmon checking Simmons cleanly and safely twice before the season is over 
You're welcome.
Literally had a dream last night that the Grizzlies would win again tonight. So fucking happy it became true.
That's a good day! Now we need Jazz, Suns and Mavs victories for a GREAT day. Our second pick will be nice aswell BOIZZZ. Best case scenario is we end up with 17th pick cause Heat and Bucks are too far behind to catch up with Twolves.
AYTON AND DONCIC! I love you Portland 
serves em right
And the suns play the kings and mavs so there's a chance they win 2 more
I bet ur parents don't love you
Wasn’t sure either but it seems like we will both have the same odds to get the #2 pick so I’ll take it!
Try dreaming that the Suns start winning. Or I become a billionaire. Either works.
Well booker has not been playing many of there recent games because he's "hurt". But your right...I definitely feel like there should be a benefit being new to the top of the draft. 
no clue lmfao they've had enough top picks to make a contender and what do they have to show for it, 19 fucking wins with Booker. talk about an abysmal drafting franchise jesus we've won more games with our lower picks like Collins/Prince/Schroder 
We lost Bledsoe at the beginning of this season. Definitely changed our potential to win games. We've been dealing with a string of G-league point guards and an interim coach. The Suns suck dick right now and we deserve a high pick.
Hopefully the grizz can win 1 more and we lose out. But man this game against Orlando coming up really might be the difference between 2nd and 4th. 
Winning that coin flip is huge too, as it reorders the draft if you don't get a top 3.
“lost” bledsoe lmao
Just odds tho. It's very possible for a team to finish with the second best odds, but still end up with the 4th pick.
I'll be honest, a top 3 pick this year is like a 1 overall pick in most drafts, 'this draft is really deep
Good guy Hawks

takes pick, but gives new franchise high and keeps team in the playoffs
The perfect heist. We steal the L, after they swindled our teagues 
Well you missed the 10 straight years of playoffs and we just started a RETOOL WHILE STAYING COMPETITIVE period. We have a good amount of young potential and possibly a top 2 pick in the upcoming draft. The Cloud Daddies will be memed into an NBA championship within the next 3 years. 
We suck and will continue to suck for a couple more years, so if you become a fan now you will be in on the ground floor before we start our fivepeat.

Watch games on TV.  The broadcasters give lots of info on the players before/during games.  Go to some games at Philips while the tickets are cheap.  200s sections or better, otherwise you'll be in a barren wasteland of empty seats. Follow Hawks on twitter for the memes.
All memes aside, I gotta disagree. I think Horford has been one of the most underrated players for just about his whole career. He doesn't fill up the box score, but all his coaches and teammates have never had anything but good things to say about him. 

Baptist has a lot of promise but Horford has already had a very solid career and I think he's got plenty left in the tank.
to be perfectly honest... I didn't know what to title this post so I settled. 
Sure but I think Collins can be Horford + rebounds. He has the shot, learning the defense, the playmaking/passing are developing very nicely, and ofc, can rebound the ball
Pretty cool dunk but I feel like that was a better display of his improved shot creation
What are you talking ab- oh wait. You're not wrong. That was a very Blake griffinesque play
Next year I think we'll see a lot more creation from him 
May you enjoy the retooling while we remain competitive. Also John Collins is your dad. 
lmao I'm trying to get in before the other bandwagons join
I pray we make the right choice this time. i.e. Marvin Williams 2.0
All the way. I'm excited because Atlanta just had this cool look to it
Awesome! Being a full blown Atlanta fan takes a lot of guts! Where are you from? 
I'm from the middle of nowhere in Florida. I've always wanted to love in a city with a sports team and made a promise when I would be a fan of what ever city my college was in. 
I’m from Georgia but I lived in St Augustine for like 14 years growing up. Glad you’re coming to Atlanta! It’s so much fun (the city and being a fan). 
Curious, do we miss a lot more shots which allows him to get more offensive rebounds? 
Honestly this was my first thought
our beloved memer is no more. farewell king 😔☝️
aka the person who runs the official Hawks twitter. 

As you all know our twitter is really great so he'll be sorely missed.[ He also did an AMA here this offseason that I'd recommend you all check out.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AtlantaHawks/comments/2apcyk/hawks_social_media_coordinator_jaryd_wilson_ask/) 
The only good part of the season were the memes...
Watching Hawks games hurts this year because I want them to win but know it's better if they lose uggh
Hawks will win!  My $1000 on ML says so! 
Wolves fan here, is Isaiah Taylor always this good? Cause wow
Man.. I love JTB. I hope he stays like forever.
Guys please for the love of everything that is holy let us win this game
Glad we are making them work for the W but let’s not get too carried away😬
I'm willing to throw away the Timberwolves pick and a better chance at the lottery out of pettiness for those Fortnite comments tho
And yet I'm like 99.99% sure that will happen because Atlanta 
I dunno is Karl always this good?
I believe we will do a nice job with the rebuild. I can’t imagine otherwise because returning to that cycle of slightly above average-good every year would be torturous. 
Barrett or reddish seem perfect for us, maybe we can snag keldon or little with the Cavs pick too
We really need to win the lottery to get him with the first pick
is there a way to leverage your beautiful formatting? I can do it if no one else jumps on it
Oh that might be an RES function then. https://redditenhancementsuite.com/ pretty handy if you use reddit in your browser often. 
Ah. I'll do it from home PC in the morning then. Thanks!
Sixers fan here - best of luck with your tank. Being a bottom-dwelling team doesn't always feel great, but the excitement of climbing into playoff contention makes it all worth it.

Please be nice to our baby Markelle when he comes to visit on Friday
Lol got eeemmmmm
Pretty sure its just reality. FWIW, I find it funny. And I hope to god we lose.
it's pretty impressive how quickly both the sixers and their fans developed such obnoxious arrogance.
Same. I don't care what teams think of us this year. Let us collect these L's and get a top 2 pick.
I agree. Everything in an NBA players life is under a microscope- why get all bent out of shape when they joke around a little bit? The video gave me a good laugh. 
Lol its hilarious seeing these fans of a trash mediocre garbage franchise getting all butthurt over a joke. 
Lol
The salt levels are incredible 
This is so accurate. Aussie’s will take the piss even if it’s directed at themselves.
I'm starting to warm up to drafting Young if we fall out of the top 3. But you'd really take him over Doncic?
It was just a light joke, jeez.
A whole year of Eagles fans gloating about winning the Super Bowl ahead...
Collins will be better
Its not really shit talking or trash talking, I don't think Simmons really meant any malice from that comment. Its just the reality of the situation. Its like how a lot of teams without any proven records get beat by the Lakers. They assume the Lakers aren't very good so they go out and enjoy everything LA can offer. These guys aren't robots.

The only difference is that someone was playing video games on a Twitch steam rather than telling their teammate at a club to stay longer. 
Its actually pretty impressive.  Losing that many games is hard.
As a Pirates fan (not a Steelers or Penguins fan), I’d say we aren’t obnoxious. If we start to win sometime, then yeah we might be
Tyler Dorsey will be better
you're still trash, too, and the t-wolves are still the better team.
Lol ok
>it's pretty impressive how quickly both the sixers and their fans developed such obnoxious arrogance.

HAHAHAHAHAH BEST JOKE OF ALL TIME 
Tyler Cavanaugh will be better
How does it feel to be able to say this for the first time in over a decade
Fit wise, that would be amazing

Sadly I don't think he seems like a schlenk kinda guy, doesn't seem to be big in the character department
Last season, I really wanted to grab him for cheap, but this season, I think he's got too much of an attitude to go for. These previous philly picks were traded for cheap for a reason; people did the same thing with Okafor saying "he just needs a chance". No, they don't get a chance because they aren't very good.
Great season considering his draft position, he’s outperformed everyone’s expectations. He’s definitely a long term starter and has an All Star ceiling imo. I think he would greatly benefit from another offensive playmaker to get him the ball, because many times he doesn’t get the touches he needs because our guard play is kinda bad in that aspect. 
I wouldn’t say he’s fallen off. He’s gotten a lot better on defense. Maybe in points he’s fallen off but the Hawks have been a one man show every night lately with the man changing between Dennis and Taurean. Bazemore too before he got hurt. He averages more blocked per game than Deandre Jordan and should easily put up better offensive numbers if the team was good enough to get him the ball 
You know that Hox player development staff will be good for him. He'll benefit from better guard play in the future, but I believe his ceiling is a potential All-Star reserve and otherwise very effective starting PF who can be a great small ball C in fast lineups.
Luka Doncic. The white Lebron. Except he’s better than Lebron. 
The guys over on the r/NBA post bring up a good point. A felony conviction could potentially lead to his deportation from the country.
Not sure when exactly this happened but to quote Herm Edwards, "nothing good happens after midnight."
This confirms that Hawks fans at the Dekalb DA’s office are in on the tank too. Huge if true.
I wonder if we could get him on a ten day. Would be a nice gesture and would definitely not help us win.
To be fair that should kind of be expected of a normal dude fighting a professional athlete 
No guarantee we get top 3 and I'm not opposed to taking him in the top 3 anyway.


Edit: since we're downvoting opinions, I'll just let you know I'd draft him #2 over Ayton. Suck it
> Mmkay, sure, no one with money has ever gone to prison in history

Yes, that's exactly what I said. Carry on 
Already got John Collins and they'd basically play the same role imo. Doncic, Ayton, and Trae are my top 3. Rather have Jaren Jackson than Bagley.
I'm worried about the T-wolves. Butler needs to come back asap. Also, we better lose to orlando 
Shower thought 

People have been trying to shove the Steph curry comparison down everyone's throats since day one. 

But what if Trae Young's NBA comparison isnt Curry

What if Trae Young's NBA comparison was Tony Parker?

Idk, the more I think about it the more I can see it. I know they aren't a perfect match, but it's something to ponder on
It's lottery protected for two more years after this one before it turns into 2 seconds. We're getting it sooner or later.
Nice. I expect they settle in at 7/8 which would be perfect.
I don't think they'll miss the playoffs, their remaining schedule is pretty easy
They play Denver twice and the jazz. And they kind of suck. 
GUYS CHILL!! Twolves have the most "win now" mentality. They want to end a huge playoff drought and every loss hurts them more than anyone else in the league. Jimmy Butler will probably be back for their last 3 games aswell.

Edit: That means vs Lakers, Grizzlies, Nuggets.
Hey it’s nice and all but the TWolves has to lose for it to happen. They are the 8 seed. I’d rather get 3 and 18 than just 2. 

Then again, I’m Ayton or Doncic or bust right now. 
nuggets also lost.  I think this was literally the best case scenario...wolves will get in as a 7th or 8th seed.
wolves play denver 2 times so that will really be the deciding factor.  
This pick is looking really nice if it does pan out our way though. 
I have no expectations from today's games. Even if I get 10 minutes of play for the Twolves, they will still win. 
Hope for the griz win. If the Twolves drop out to the nuggets they need the pick more than we do anyway because that would be just downright sad. I'm crossing my fingers for the 15th pick from them.
There is no fucking way Twolves lose their Playoffs spot. Their schedule is the easiest possible. Nuggets need to win two more games than Twolves and they play Raptors, OKC, Blazers, Sixers, Pacers, Bucks, LAC, Twolves (x2). 
Yeah ofc, but still, Nuggets will probably win something like 4-5 games (OKC, Pacers, Twolves at home and LAC, Bucks). That means Twolves are fine with 4 wins, which should be a "lock in" (Memphis, Dallas, Lakers, us)
Really Im a sixer fan lurking on the hawks sub cause I think they are a fun team. I do not know too much about the team admittedly. I agree with what you said.
I don't understand the use of this meme.  Why would anybody need to change your mind about this?  It's 100% accurate.

Lol dedmon how you gonna play 14 minutes and not get one single point, assist, or rebound
Better than KKK
>a project


He's already an elite defender and shooter for his position. He's a perfect fit next to Collins and JJJ's offensive ceiling could be really high with the flashes he's shown dribbling.


Edit: just to reiterate, his defensive ceiling is really really high, like DPOY potential
I think his ceiling may be a better version of Horford. IMO, they're very similar players. Athletic bigs who are mobile on the defensive end, good passers, and have a reliable jumpshot from the perimeter. The only difference is that JJJ already has more range than Horford did when he came into the league. A guy like Horford with a top 5 pick isn't bad at all, he'll fit in seamlessly into Bud's system.
>Bagley, MPJ, Trae Young, and Bamba have looked much more impressive and dominant.

true for all except for MPJ, who looked like garbage in his brief playing time for Mizzou

those players have also received much more playing time and in better situations with higher usage. JJJ is one of the youngest players in the draft and has the best combination of high block rate and 3P% among his peers. his upside may be limited to apex Serge Ibaka (which would still be a damn good player)

I disagree with calling him a project. All rookies (aside from like, old Malcolm Brogdon types and rare talents like Anthony Davis) are projects to some extent, including all of the top guys in this draft (including Ayton and to a lesser extent Doncic). JJJ is a proven shooter and rim defender. In that sense, I would call him less of a project. 
I don't know. That Kyle Korver Kid is pretty good.
I love JJJ but let's cut the hyperbole his *floor* is not the combined prowess of the top two defensive players in the league and also with Dirk level shooting from deep. 

I think he projects to be a Horford/Noah level player which is certainly worth drafting in the Top 5.
I would take him big in college are becoming had to find 
Oh

Oh God

Oh my God, I can't believe I didn't see it before

Young bench forward that produces but in limited minutes on a great team

Young bench forwarward that produces in limited minutes on a great team


No, no, no, no, no I am not about j³, the shades of marvin with him are too real
Good bot
We’re gonna win- please no. 

Moose will drop 43- please yes.
We promise to win if you promise to lose badly enough for us to rest
In this order I would go: Ayton, Doncic, JJj, bagley, porter, bamba, trae young

Then with minne pick depends on who we take first, but I would love either Gafford, Lonnie Walker, Jontay Porter, Simons. 

And maybe someone like Rawls alkins or Grayson Allen with the Houston pick. 
Doncic or JJJ would be best-case outcomes IMO. If we manage to get either of those guys, I'll be over the moon.

Trae Young is a guy who wouldn't necessarily be my first pick, but who I'd be excited if we drafted because our GM is the guy who scouted and drafted Curry, and I trust his ability to identify "the next Curry" more than I trust my own, so if he thinks Young can be that guy then I'd be on board.

Beyond that, though... I'd probably be more willing than most people to take calls about trading our pick. I know, it's not a popular opinion. But I'm not completely sold on any of the other top guys, and I'm becoming increasingly convinced that draft night is the best time to swindle other teams in trades. People have a way of fixating on particular players and becoming way too invested in getting those guys specifically, to the point that they become willing to give up more in a trade for those specific guys than they would have been for a generic top-3 pick before the season began. [\(Remember, for example, what the Celtics reportedly offered the Hornets for the chance to draft Justise Winslow?\)](https://sports.yahoo.com/celtics-really-wanted-to-trade-up-for-justise-winslow--offered-hornets-six-picks-223512211.html?y20=1) So I'd at least be willing to listen to offers.

For our later picks, the guys I've been most interested in lately are (in no particular order) Zhaire Smith, Jalen Brunson, Josh Reaves, Jontay Porter, De'Anthony Melton, Landry Shamet, Khyri Thomas, Chimezie Metu, Shake Milton, and *of course, obviously,* Killian Tillie. But there are also a lot of guys I haven't done enough homework on yet, so at this point I'm more inclined to just trust our front office to pick whoever they think is best. Their recent track record in the draft has been really good.

Also, I'd be interested in seeing which of our guys currently on our roster end up getting traded on draft night. Hopefully there's a lot of action.
The correct answer is Ayton or bust.  Best player in the draft.  
Well we're not getting the first pick so good luck with that lol
In 📥👇 this ⬇😕 order 🎁 I 🙋 would 😏 go: 🏃🏻 Ayton, Doncic, JJj, bagley, porter, bamba, trae young 💦

Lol the 💦 after trae young
The Atlanta hawks are the best team in the nba, not kidding.
Phoenix vs Orlando will be awesome 
I feel like we should root for orlando, so we're pretty much guaranteed top 3 in the lottery 
It's actually kind of crazy that the John the Baptist name came from this sub and is now literally being used by the hawks commentators on TV lol
NOBODY TELL JOHN HOW GOOD HE IS. 

But seriously, very impressed with his development already. Kid is a stud. 
I know. Love it.
What about making that dream come true? I know the Hawks won’t be much opposed to it 
He hit a 3 so he also remained competitive and what more can we ask than that 
GG guys, glad your guys didn’t get injured tonight

I'm happy to report that you're not entirely correct. Sec 222!
To be fair the arena Is still extremely empty, 
I remember when the Big 3 was at Miami, you could hear our more Miami chants.
Nice!!!! I’m in 205 and the only one anywhere near me cheering for ATL. Question do you think we will ever make consistent free throws 
I think it was more of a joke that even at Philips there are more warriors fans than hawks fans... Not that warriors games can't sell out 😒
> only one near me

Same.

> consistent free throws

Lol.
Nothing I love more on a friday night than hearing Bob say “Swaggy P” 🤗😌😇
Strong feeling we win.
Damn look at his ankle, more like 135° *angle* am I right
I agree. His upside is too great. He could be our future #2 if we don’t land Doncic with our first pick. 
10/10 legendary shitpost
I wear Hawks stuff around town but I own significantly more Falcons/United/Braves gear. 
right ... build a core around Prince Schroeder and Collins ... it will be fun to watch
10-day contracts always work better for the players than the team. Damion Lee is a good example. It's not a big commitment for the team though. 
Did we sign Rudy gay?
Rudy Gay is Killian Tillie
My ideal, somewhat slightly realistic but still very much optimistic scenario I'm hoping for right now is both he and we fall to the third pick.
If we don't get ayton I would love him. Then use that minne pick on gafford from arkansas.  Mmmmh
It's the one part of the sub I genuinely, unironically don't know how to change. So like, I would if I knew how but uh, yeah I don't.
So we want Minnesota to win right? 
Bagley looks really good 
I'm not too worried about Orlando. I definitely think they will win more games on the remaining schedule than us.
hello friends it's your free talk friday for this week, free-talk friday let's go.
What's the best IASIP episode?
  
I watched Charlie MacDennis for the first time with my gf last night. So fucking funny.
Thats a great one, probably my favorite! Keep an eye out for Charlie Work, thats a hilarous one. 
smh they thought they could tank better than us
Only three teams in the league who can tank better than us and the Ass-Eaters aren’t one of them! 
They can eat ass better than us but that’s it 
How do you treat rest? More rest. 
No we’re not trying to heal him right away. He needs an offseason of rest or 2 and he’ll be good
Budenholzer is too good of a coach for a tank. 
Well the sub is pretty active but its just no one watches the games lol
They’re too confident that the L is in the bag already.

😩
go eat some more ass, you’re just salty that you’ve been out-tanked
Playoffs contenders and teams that have the "win now" mentality do that in similar situations. Don't be lunatic.

Edit: Btw that's what rest means. You don't need to be hurt when you rest. Get your facts straight boi.
I love this sub.
beautiful
Honestly embarrassing.
They got to the Eastern conference finals. I think that was probably the highest possible outcome for that team.

Losing Thabo and Delly wouldn't have turned a sweep into a series win, so I don't really see how you can argue that they never reached the success they could have had.

-

All I'm trynna say is that its a bit rich to say that after *years* of being relatively successful and making the play offs, then capping it off with a 60 win season and a trip to the ECF that the Hawks are the most unlucky team of all other than Nets or Kings.

What about like the Magic losing two star Centres to the Lakers, The Bulls with Rose, The Hornets being unlucky enough for MJ to take an interest in them (lol), the Knicks just because etc etc
Thats not exclusive to the Hawks though.

Same can be said for the Bulls, the Grizzlies, Dallas etc.

-

I think the hawks have had their fair share of luck tbh.

Every team has a bit of bad luck and has to rebuild every now and then I think there are plenty of much more unlucky teams who would have loved to have had the success of the Hawks in recent years.
>What should the Hawks do in the next two drafts

Okay everyone you've heard this one before, say it with me! 

BEST...
I love Bol , but RJ Barrett is something else though. 
Not to mention  Zion, Reddish, Quentin Grimes, Langford... Next year's class looks nice at the top too. We buildin a dynasty bois
Yeah but then we get a fresh new  d a d 
you got the first letter right
Definitely,  I wouldn't mind having Bol because of how we develop players. He's a unicorn in the making lol
that's it. we take the best penis available.
Lol. Tru dat.
if you eat ass ur gay
son if you don't eat her ass then u gay and that's facts
With as well as bud develops wings we should for sure be trying to get him with one of our later picks. For a high school prospect, he's got almost all the things you look for. 

But honestly, if the wolves pick falls low enough, I'd rather get porter, shake, Jacob Evans, or maybe a lotto talent that happened to slip through the cracks
I just made a threat vouching for him. I think the Hawks should definitely pick him up. Dude has star potential and we are great at developing wings. This is *Atlanta* after all.
I’m hoping he falls a little further and that wolves pick is like 16-19. I’ve also been warming up to trying to trade dennis and a pick maybe more to get Sexton. I love me some Dennis Schroeder I just don’t think he will be what we want when the rebuild comes to a head like with the 76ers now. 
I still think porter makes it to top 5 and isn’t wolves the wolves pick top 15 protected? It’s hard to tell what pieces are gonna fall where with the rebuild. I’d almost want prince to move to 2 if his shooting keeps improving and for us to draft a forward that can play both 3 and 4. 
Lol Im talking about MPJs brother who basically carried that Mizzou team to the tourney, Jontay Porter :p
prince at the two? he's a forward. just because he's shooting better doesn't make him a two. haha
It’s one second rounder. Fit isn’t a huge factor. 
> Draymond was more of a playmaker probably because his team at Michigan State had more offensive weapons than UGA’s team this past season.

Draymond was more of a playmaker because Draymond is an outstanding playmaker. It's that simple. 
I understand that but it’s another undersized 4. He’s a good player yes, but we’ve been down this road before
Can you name a player that was as dominant as Yante was this past season  in a good conference that went undrafted? 
Jonathan Motley is the most recent example and he is even better than Yante.
Who are we rooting for? SAC

I love it 
Tbh most of this is for meme purposes. Noone expects players to lose on purpose, because most of them, if not all, won't be here during our next prime (I expect JTB, TP and Schroder to be around). They have a career to pursue, so they have to fight their own game of inches! 

Our position in the standings is a result of an inexperienced team, which lacks depth and talent in some cases. One of the things I appreciate in that team, is that we don't tank shamelessly. Furthermore, we attract good exposure with appearances like that, or TP's hot streak, or JTB's highlights/solid games, etc. Last but not least, Delaney said it all, plus this draft class is Top heavy and we 'll be around, so everything is fine atm. 
I don't expect them to try to lose. I expect them to fight to win every single game. 

I just want them to lose. Gimme that sweet sweet top 3 pick. I've been saying we should blow it up since LeBron destroyed us, after our best regular season ever. That was such a fun season, but it was clear we weren't getting over the top. 
Dorsey is good for fantasy teams, cause he scores some 3PT. He ll get minutes, cause Bazemore is out for the season. Morris is out for 2 weeks. Lee will keep getting ~20' of play but I would pick Dorsey instead.
I love that logo tbh
Always loved Korver. RiP to his brother, no one should have to go through that. 
Absolutely tragic. I too lost my brother. There is no pain like it. Much love to the Korver family. <3 
Hoping we can get top 2. I think we have a chance because penny said the grizzlies are going to try to win.
Hope ur right
Half the teams are in top 3 range. The problem is that we’re also in top 7 range
I think top 3 is fine. Memphis seems to be looking for Bagley. That means we can get either Ayton or Doncic.
yes please this would be perfect

edit: yay thx mods
I think this shit is hilarious lol 
Rudy Gay
This was good.

at this point I don't think matching or passing PHO/MEM's losses is a realistic possibility anymore. best case scenario is we end up third from the bottom.

RuBiO iS a goOD dEfEnDer
Whoa I thought DtB was done with youtube? This makes me happy
I mean, he is. Just makes it more impressive
Lucky for us this draft is deep. As long as we get one of Ayton, Luka, Porter or Bagely I'll be real happy. Hell even getting J3 or Bamba isn't that upsetting. 
as he should. it's the players job to go out there and get wins.
Bye deandre ayton you had a good run with us 😪
Jazz fan here, I apologize for ruining your team tanking efforts; I hope you guys are still are able to land the best players during the draft.
Alleged all-nba defensive 1st team rim protector Rudy Gobert allows 13 of 21 2-point attempts by alleged greatest point guard of all time Dennis Schroder. 

Can I get Dennis' face on [this](https://hamlethamster.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/the-driver-1978_poster.jpg)?

Also: can you believe that statline by Jonas Jerebko? We're the ones tanking here; 5 rebounds and 0/0/0/0 in 13 minutes? Really?
Nice-Dennis points
Bad-WE WON AND NOW WE HAVE TO LOSE OUT FOR A GOOD PICK FUCKKKKK
They still try hard to win & make Playoffs??  
No need to win...
When you keep pulling your good players to tank but your bench keeps winning...
Bro he is going off lmao
lmao
Dennis statline is pretty nice though
:D 

Now I have something to post whenever Dennis goes off!
you lost a game in the great tank race although won a game in a standings. i think a win in the tank race column would’ve been more beneficial for the hawks 
Okay but that's not what I was talking about
Welcome to the Hawks!

You guys are learning German so quickly!

https://www.reddit.com/r/AtlantaHawks/comments/80ap4l/brother_was_playing_fortnite_with_ayton_so_i_had/duuvgny/
I hope so. I really want Ayton but Doncic should be available at #3. 
No just must be flaired appropriately. Guten Tag!
>should

Lol really? who goes 2?
Believe it or not but I’m starting to see mocks where JJJ goes as high as 2 and Bagley going top 2. 
We're getting a great player with any of those guys. Not to mention Marvin Bagley would still be available.
that's true, but he reminds me a bit too much of John 
He looks very interested in partaking in this photograph
Nice, I met him before at an ingles  
cool. I didnt know james corden was on this sub
We were all hammered and he gave me until he reached his floor to take the picture. Lol Definitely wasn’t in the mood to take a picture. Met the entire hawks team this morning before they headed to Vivint Smart Home Arena. I’m a big fan of Bazemore. Loved him on the dubs 
We've tried benching our best players, and I guess that's not working...should we give coach bud a leave of absence for the rest of the season?
What r they doing??  
No need to win...
It does matter. Miles will get too many minutes and screw the tank. 
We will never have a top 10 player
Ok Dennis...
Most of it is joking ya know? Also it is a completely unnecessary win. 
Exactly that.
That’s way too many
THe Alttlanta Hawks Basketball ball Team. Have a great! enjoy the Game . Boo Utih Jizz!!!
:]
Booker is almost definitely not playing, but I hope phoenix somehow magically gets the win. Their fanbase deserves a win here and there 
we're good fam
You'd think they'd be better after tanking for so long. 
We changed our name to the clouds and they couldn't win.
FULL SPEED AHEAD TANK MASTER BUD
Nice 
I'm guessing the nba media guy who made this imploded from having to put the Hawks logo on anything positive
By a fairly large margin too
Lovely.
Nice
Depends on who is available. He’s a 4 if it were Ayton or Bamba and a 5 is we drafted Bagley or Porter. 
His jumper is coming along just fine IMO; I think the 4 spot is where he belongs in the long term (ideally alongside a rim-protecting 5 like JJJ or [one of those top guys in the 2020 draft](http://www.nbadraftroom.com/p/2020-nba-mock-draft.html))
Nice
I subscribe to all team subs to keep tabs though I don't pay a lot of attention to the tanking teams (no offense). 

Though I have seen some of Prince's statlines which have been impressive.
Nice
With a top pick you draft the best player available. Collins is obviously one of our most promising talents, and has the ability to fit in multiple positions. Not sure what you are missing here...
Nice
Nice
Is this picture literally just  a weather forecast? I love this subreddit 
Looks like it's gonna be a beautiful week for retooling bois😎
This really is the best nba sub
if Denver and the clippers could just please go on a huge losing streak... 
Okay, I'll tell Travis
Thanks! 
It would be good for the Grizzlies to win tonight, but I think Brooklyn will win.~~ I actually think we'd rather have the Knicks win tonight, because New York has been performing much worse than Chicago in this last stretch.

And Chicago has games left against Charlotte, Brooklyn, Brooklyn, Orlando, and Detroit, while New York has games left against Detroit, Charlotte, and Orlando. I'm more scared of New York at this point~~
NY is five games in front, they aint catching up. 
That makes no sense, NY having 2 more easier games  means there will be higher chances of winning those 2 games. On the other hand, Chicago will likely lose those games because they have tougher opponents.
uhhhh...

Yeah you're completely right LMAO

idk what I was thinking oops
All good lol
Depends on the workouts/medicals. If our buddies at P3 say he's still got it, we need to make sure we don't let him slip away and become the "embiid" of the draft 
He's been in my top 2 or 3 all year, but I've started having second thoughts about him lately. He just doesn't seem like a natural ball-handler/facilitator type player, so I'm starting to worry that his upside is more like, I don't know, Harrison Barnes than Kevin Durant. He hasn't really given any sign that he can defend well on the perimeter either, not to mention all the questions about his health.

Admittedly, he does look a lot better to me if I think of him as a PF rather than a SF. But we've already got a guy in John Collins who I think can and should be our PF of the future, so just in terms of chemistry and maximizing our team as a whole it would make more sense to have someone like Doncic, Young, or JJJ who can complement Collins' skill-set and still give us open spots in the right positions for the 2019 and 2020 drafts.

MPJ's probably still in my top 5 or 6 though.
I am a Mizzou fan so I would selfishly love it
It would be a nice counter to have against Boston
Could be perfect for next year’s tank tho.
Yeah but in the top 3 are you drafting for fit or potential? Ayton, Doncic, Bagley are the three players in this draft with franchise altering ability IMO. You have to take BPA in the early draft, otherwise you could end up with Shelden Williams instead of Brandon Roy.
Aaron Holiday is really good too, he wil be around the 25 to 35 range. 6'1 with a 6'7 wingspan, have a strong build and great quickness, can really shot, score and defend. 
Yante would fit well in our system, I really do hope we can grab him somewhere. 
Anybody know what happens if we reflect the sun right back at the sun? I'm pretty sure it explodes. Fact check me bitch. Therefore we shall be known as the Atlanta Mirrors

Can we please?

Pretty please?
you caught me empty handed good sir
I think Collins has a ton of work to do on **defense**, passing, and shooting (arguable, but needs to show consistency) before he can compare with Millsap. Millsap in his prime was the kind of player that could guard basically anyone in the league besides superstar PGs and Lebron. Collins has a looooong way to go on that end.

I think Bazemore could be decently comparable to Korver-- he's worse on shooting but better at basically everything else, except maybe passing, where they're probably comparable.

Taurean I agree has a realistic ceiling that is quite a bit higher than Demarre's stint with us.

Schroder is probably at Teague's level already, minus the 3pt shooting.

And I have no idea what a prospective center would look like.

All in all, I agree that we'll be in a great position in 2 years, even if we don't get a high draft pick next season. I'm excited for what's to come!
Alright alright I love JC but let's chill with the 'he might be better than prime Millsap in two years' lol 
You're underrating how good Korver was that year. The gravity he demanded was like #3 in the league and that's part of what drove our offense so hard. Even if Baze is ever as good on paper, he won't make this the January Player of the Month team.
https://www.peachtreehoops.com/2018/2/20/17029358/john-collins-atlanta-hawks-all-star-break-rookie-development

Check this out. JC is getting much better at being a rim protector, and not fouling out. Obviously, he isn't near Millsap level now. But I'm optimistically projecting, that he can get to a respectable defender in 2 years. Your right when you say he can't guard the Lebrons(and I don't think he will be able to ever), but I think he can offer solid rim protection and be as good as al horford is this season.
He plays completely differently. I said that the defensive, and offensive effort he gives towards other power forwards, would be similar. He will never be able to guard 2,3s, but I think he can become successful at guarding 4s and 5s. Offensively I'm pretty sure he can be better, as he has dipped into the threes, and has a pretty good PER for a rookie. I think in 2 years he can average 18/11. With a decent 3FG% on limited 3 pt attempts.
One of our main strengths that year was that we were able to stretch the defense because everyone (including our center) on the floor was able to shoot the 3. Teams adapted to that in the playoffs which is why we didn't look as strong. A true center wouldn't have allowed us to stretch the defense like that.
He has the physical profile to be as good defensively, just needs more experience which is kinda hard to extrapolate 
Sure, but Millsap during his Hawks time is a 4-time all-star and was an all-NBA level defender. JC is looking really promising but it's easier to put up numbers on a tanking team than on a competing team. Can he ever get to that level? Who knows, he might but he's not gonna be playing at an all-star level within the next two seasons, and being able to guard 4-5's is still ways off from shutting them down on defense. 

It's fun to be excited about our young guys but let's stay a little realistic - JC is far from proven and your scenario is close to a best case, everything going right scenario (especially with all guys combined), which doesn't happen a whole lot. 
Baze would have to be really fucking good at D for that to be comparable. 
Best basketball player ever
If he can stay consistent at like 17-20PPG (or more, even better) and gets his defense back to where it was last season than damn, have we got a great player. Either way this recent explosion has been a lot of fun.
Asking the right questions.
TP has 2 real ankles so hes better than steph
Taurean is blossoming and I love it so much 
These games are getting too close for comfort with Prince doing his best FGM-148 Javelin impression.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FGM-148_Javelin
Another perfect game
So we're just gonna sit here and not talk about JC with the fookin noice 15/12 and +13?

Dude is still out chere getting better, thy will be done
John Collins: +13


I want u to play but Chill lmao
Except every time he's dropped 38 points we've lost, so is he actually the best?
Good bot
True af but I don't see our FO making that sort of decision.

 I'm really banking on a good coach to get hired so we can use Giannis to his full potential, but that might not work out. 
Looks like the perfect outcome tonight! Get that pick!
He's good but he's no Killian Tillie
While he is benefiting from as much usage he can handle right now, the fact that he is maintaining efficiency and putting up monster numbers tells me that he has all-star upside
TP is a budding star with major upside if he stays healthy he will be a beast in the league for a looooong time 
Lurking the sub not a fan but he’s gonna easily be a max player when his contract is up. That size, strength, defense and shooting? Definite max 
At 54.3 TS% I'm not at all unhappy with Taurean's offensive production. His FG% isn't great, but I think that's partly to do with a high percentage of his shots coming from 3. I actually like Taurean's all-around offensive game; he needs more polishing, but his shooting stroke is obviously good and I've always been impressed by his finishing at the rim, especially in transition.

I do agree that once we get better players around him, he'll have better opportunities to take smarter shots and devote more energy to D
It's  more that he has to increase his 2pt efficiency. His TS% should be much higher where his 3pt% is.
I'm convinced the suns and grizz aren't going to win another game this season

Also, wow, have all of the top prospects (besides Bagley, notably) been pretty trash this tourney or is it just me? MPJ with the low efficiency, Ayton invisable, J³ really invisable, Bamba didn't really look super worth it, Bagley however hasn't lost a fuckin step and it's been quite impressive watching him. 

For a very reactionary new big board for me (this isn't including fit for us):

1) Doncic

2) Bagley

3) Ayton

4) Sexton

5) Bamba

6) j³

<POWER GAP>

9001) Trae Young
Tank has been going super well today. Let's hope for some strong finishes by Chicago, Sacramento, and Memphis. On a side note, how do tiebreakers work for draft picks?   
Cool. I'm worried we're gonna beat Orlando and tie them, but we'll see 
Teague has been fine in Minnesota. With Butler, Towns and Wiggins there's not much left over for him. Tough gig but he's doing his thing: 37% from three and 8th in the league in assists with a decent assists to turn over ratio. Not ground breaking stuff but he can be the starting point guard on a good team.

Definitely no regrets about trading him for pick 12. A good first step in the re-build.
I think you're right. They asked about an email I should have received but let me have the promo anyway. Thanks for answering. 
Dennis is my favorite Hawk, but with his antics on and off the court, he has no room to talk about anyone.
We've started doing the same. Wes and JJB are out. Kyle Collinsworth is our only "true" shooting guard at the moment! Very exciting!
Marc and Reke played 33 minutes each against the Bulls and they still lost by 1 point even with Cameron Payne, Antonio Blakeney, and Cristiano Felicio playing 24-25 minutes apiece. Who exactly do you doubt there? Conley?
Who are y'all looking for the Hawks to land in free agency regardless of what happens in the draft?
Honestly I don't feel like the organization is necessarily married to the idea of Dennis being our long-term franchise point guard. I could see him being traded this off-season if the deal is right.
Honestly I don't really want anyone, *maybe* Noel if we don't draft a center, but all the cap room we have is becoming more and more valuable as the cap normalizes
yeah Doncic is a LeBron type point-forward, he already has a higher upside than Dennis in terms of creation, not to mention Dennis' abominable defense.
I think it has been a problem at times too, lol. But yeah it is fun to watch there fringe guys goes out there and not leave anything on the court. 
soo, I Honestly think this is betterk cuz theres no chance Memphis has more wins than us, but we could end up going over CHI-town so realistically I think its the best outcome. Now, Phoenix is a team that we need to see win, and they need to let Booker go off.
this is true. maybe the lottery gods will favor us anyway
Taurean Prince gunna be somethan special in dis here Natnl Basketball Socciation
The crowd lost it when we got Kaminsky to miss consecutive FTs in the 4th.  Then on the way out they were handing out Libman sponge wands, but attendance was low so some people just left carrying boxes full of them lol
Lol
if he turns out to be good in the nba im gonna be aggressively demanding an nba front office job until all teams have called the cops  on me. 
I've watched lots of Gonzaga this year and this guy is actually a great player. Played like ass yesterday though
Lol that's the thing. This whole time y'all have been memeing, he's actually been good
God rip all our funny memes now
He says on the Hawks reddit they say they are undefeated and we are right because a win is a win and loss is still a win
How did u make this so quick
With everyone healthy, they are a much better team than the Hawks.
Ayton/sexton 
Ayton/miles bridges is my dream scenario. 

I could be ok with doncic and Jontay porter too if we don't get lucky with the lottery or the wolves losses...We shall see. 
Sexton will be drafted ahead of Trae Young. I think he will be top 5 honestly. 
lol nope
Definitely possible but I don't see it happening. Someone will get baited into drafting him too high I feel like. Not that I don't think he can be great, just feels like such a risky pick. 
Warm body for the roster if I had to guess, Im assuming this deal isn't anything bank worthy
And warm bodies are very good because people forget that Basketball is a Winter sport.
These are my top 9 and I'm 99% we're gonna end up with the sixth pick anyways so the top 5 doesn't really matter. 
 
1. Doncic
2. Ayton
3. JJJ
4. MPJ
5. Bagley
6. Bamba
7. Sexton
8. Trae
9. Bridges

For me its always about who fits the best in Buds system, and they've been defensive minded smart players (like Milldad), and I think Doncic is the perfect fit over any other player in this draft.
All in on Luka. Our Slovenian Super Hero
MPJ probably fits the team best even though Prince is really looking good lately. The PGs in this class suck and dont fit. I like Bagley but he and Collins have a similar game and idk if having them on the court at the same time works. Honestly its a great draft but unless we get Ayton (or MPJ looks the part in the tourny) it may be hard to get a bonified star that fits our roster where we already dont have a prospect (1,2,5)
I'm gonna cry if we get the first pick


I honestly believe Ayton is going to be a bonaifde top 10 superstar  in this NBA


He changes any franchise he goes too. 



Plus he would fit with Collins well in the back court 
1A. Ayton
1B. JJJ
3. Doncic
4. MPJ
5. Bamba
6. Bagley
7. Trae


I'm a believer in JJJ's potential. I see him being the best from this draft class if he can develop his handles and play the SF position. He has a great-looking 3pt shot, has the lateral quickness/athleticism to be able to someday play the wing (if he develops his handles (under Coach Bud I think he can)), and defensively, he does things that I've only seen KD, AD, and Giannis be able to do. If he can't play the SF position I wouldn't draft him above Doncic or Ayton. I know a lot of scouts view him as a PF/C but then again a lot of scouts viewed OG Anunoby as a PF/Draymond Green Type Big Man, but the dude now looks to have a much higher ceiling officially playing the SF position for Toronto. If JJJ can pull off the wing position at the NBA Level, I don't think there is a prospect with a higher ceiling than him. I'd still take Ayton with the first overall pick though. I think he is the safest pick to get a guaranteed superstar at the NBA Level.
Which Bridges? Mikal or Miles? I'm becoming a big fan of Mikal and he's up to my 7 spot (Our top 6 are the exact same)
I’d be good with Bamba or Trae. I wish John was big enough to play a true 5 because I’m real big on Marvin Bagley
That's what I've thought of too. I like Jaren Jackson as a prospect right now over Michael Porter, but if they're both available I think we have to go MPJ
Not a fucking chance lol, Collins can play the four and has way too much potential to trade.
Says the Spurs fan. Everything has always worked out perfectly for your team. Once Pop retires and your biggest worry isn't the fact that you might not have a 50 win season again you'll be singing a different tune.
Good points. I hadn't considered it that way. Either way, I'm excited to see how it all plays out. 
I dont think he's saying we wouldn't trade Collins for anything. He's saying we wouldn't trade him in exchange for nothing. but I agree that teams arent giving up theyre good young players or a top pick, which is what we would need if we were to trade him
lol
Win for the Magic!
Kings bout to win. This is one of the best tank games we've had.
Steven Adams is cool for that. I've gone to a lot of Spurs games in my life but never got Ginobili's signature and that bums me out.
You're welcome!
aw, yeah for the most part they don't care. Done it at least 3-4 times. You can just move, too, if you took someone's seat, though I can see how one might want to avoid that interaction lol
I'll pretty much give it away at this point... just want the ticket to be used.
No Bob, you are right. Atlanta got the win!
Y'all call y'allselves the Clouds cause y'all can't stop the Grizzlies right?
I actually hope we win so we can really piss of some Thunder fans.
I think we you guys have a better chance if we keep him on the floor. Trust us. 
I know. Thunder have like 314 people. I think its best to go there.
Quality post!

I feel like if Phoenix gets the #1 pick, they'll select Ayton without a doubt (since he plays for Arizona and the fans will riot otherwise). I could also see them leaning more strongly toward Bagley than most teams, since he's also from Arizona and the Suns have a greater need for big men than wings at this point. Grizzlies fans seem more enamored of Bagley than most of us here as well. So if we end up getting the #3 pick and those two guys are the only ones off the board, I'd still consider that a fantastic situation personally.
We reeeeeeeaaaalllllyyyyyy need the magic to win this next one
I'd like to humbly request you include Hawks games on these in the future (with our own upset odds etc.).

Love the concept
 Good stuff sheep. 
Getting Ayton is not looking too good. We may very well end up being in the 5-8 range. Looks like realistically we may be having to end up deciding between Doncic, Bamba, Young, JJJ, Carter (PLS NO), & Sexton.
I would love that but I don't think there's a snowball's chance in hell of Doncic/Ayton not going 1-2 in some order
I'm no math scientist, but I think we need to lose more games and the other teams need to win more games.
You're probably right, I'm trying to convince myself we'll still be able to get Doncic somehow. Even if he's off the board, though, I'd still consider drafting JJJ or MPJ to be a "mission fucking accomplished" outcome to this season. I would even be excited if we drafted Trae Young, despite my own questions about him, just due to the fact that our GM is the man who scouted and drafted Steph Curry and would know the next Curry if he saw him.
MPJ terrifies me unless he plays well in the tournament. I would be OK with JJJ as a consolation.

And yeah if we fall back further I'm OK with Young as a high risk/high reward guy

Let's just pray the lotto gods are on our side and we get a top 2 pick
Yeah that's true, I'm just taking the experts at their word that MPJ is as good as they say he is, but I've seen so little of him in action myself that I honestly still have no idea how good he actually is. That's not even to mention the whole health thing. MPJ is basically just one huge question mark at this point.
As happy as I am for us to be leading the tank off there is a bit of sadness in this. Since the Spurs are looking like they’ll miss we could have held the longest active playoff streak in the NBA. But the tank is more important! To the bottom!
This is the greatest day in Atlanta sports history!
Yeah, it's going to be weird when the regular season ends, and that'll just be it, there won't be any more games to watch. Haven't experienced that in a long time. But definitely for the best!
Don't jump on that bandwagon until after the regular season ends though! We've got the Rockets' first-rounder, so it's better for us if Golden State can recapture that #1 seed
Damn right
BLAZEMORE!!!!

It be lit, fam

EDIT: Hawks just confirmed Blaze is out for the season. ALL HAIL LORD BLAZEMORE .420
miles plumlee liked this.

I hope he’s not seriously hurt. He’s been our best player this year and him getting a bad injury wouldn’t be good. That being said, this is pretty solid timing.

Lol idk if yall know but that was the plan actually he’s faking it for tank purposes
Our best player all season long and when it became necessary he sacrificed his own body to improve our lottery pick. I don't know what we did to deserve this guy, but I'm glad to have him. 😢
That’s good news to hear
Jackson moves much better than Turner and I'd say he's a better shooter. He can switch onto guys that Turner has no chance of guarding.
Agreed. Not third, but I’d be fine having him top 5. Ayton, Doncic, Porter, Bagley, JJJ in that order (pending seeing the real Porter in the tournament)
You better stop before the FBI catches wind of this. 
Tookie Tookie! Tillie Tillie! Gay Gay! Our future is bright bright!
I believe he can do even more with a name like Tookie Brown
Definitely Collins. He has the best chance to be here for a while and he’s got the most upside on the roster. I bought a Collins jersey recently 
Bankroll Fresh
just gotta get whatever you like bud. if you worry you won't have fun
Probably got more rebounds too.
That team was going nowhere. Be glad you didn't give the money 
Prince with 38 and we *still* lose, this has to be a perfect game from the boys
Just take it easy for the rest of the season, Kent. No need to suit up anymore big boy.
Prince really impressed me tonight
I haven't watched the game yet, I was tied up during game time, just form looking at stats.. 

* Of course Prince and his showing was outstanding. I am so happy to see him play like this. The discussions I have at work about Prince, is that he becomes a not as good Kawhi. This shows that that is possible.

* Next thing I see is that Collins got significant minutes and didn't get too many fouls. off eye test and memory I felt like this was something that he needed to work on. as a rookie things like this is to be expected to a degree. Seeing minimal fouls just makes it easier to highlight his efficiency. Once I watch the game back I want to see if he was just playing passively. His rebounding is good but doesn't stand out, the block is nice.

* Musky is still young and it's nice to see him get minutes and use them. He is only 26 years old, I don't expect him to make some crazy jump, what I do expect is him to become a great support guy. He can play C and PF and help provide shooting from the bench. 19 points on 5-6 for three is more than I could ask for.

* One thing that kinda bothers me, where were the Offensive boards. 5 from us and 13 from CHI. John is usually good for 2.6orb.

* Also we had THREE TIMES AS MANY TURN OVERS! Our Young PGs Taylor and Magette only had 3 between them.

Overall, love the tank, but I think we can tank while being a bit more competitive from everyone not named Taurean Waller-Prince.
This A. White III dude is phenomenal.
Yeah. That describes your situation accurately. But when does that torture end?
Good keep hm out for atleast a week 
do they make custom versions? hawks color with logo on the sides would be nice.
Fantastic
"Isaiah Taylor is available"

What happens if literally 11 of our players are injured or something? Do we just forfeit?
Yeah just let the community decide what it wants. I love this memery, I would kill to get something like this going on /r/bostonceltics.
You’re out of your stratosphere boy, you need to cool off
I swear to god if the Bulls pull all their good players after five minutes again Coach Bud better start running Plumdog at point or some shit. 
ive never wanted the hawks to lose more then i do now. 
Lmao the fair and honest Hawks are resting Schroeder
Implying that wouldn't help us win 196-25
Awesome 
Lol it seems like that sometimes but I don’t care if he scores 60 every night as long as we take the L. 
Bruh are our starters not outplaying your starters without Schroeder. Its not our fault your bench is good.
> doing well

It's competitive yes, but is it retooling? Remember both are important.
I think it’s just a little early if he can get healthy I think he’ll be a good bench unit 
lol they won't
i'm 95% we're getting the sixth pick at best
YOU ALL HAVE TO #TITS. We get a good pick and TS will do the rest!
The best player in the country playing in games that actually matter is a beautiful thing 
I GOT A FEAVER

AND THE ONLY PERSCRIPTION

IS MORE TOOKIE
*Nice*
So does that site not do draft videos like draft express? Do you know what the best source for those are?
I specifically avoid posting stuff like this to /r/NBA_Draft because I know people in NBA front offices like to visit Reddit occasionally, and I don't want any of them seeing good scouting like this unless they work for the Hawks, haha

(I mean, I'm pretty sure everyone reads The Stepien anyway, but still)
He's had a few nice games but i'm not seeing anything eye popping from him. He struggles to create shots for himself because of his subpar athleticism and fairly basic handle. On defense he's too small to guard 2's and too slow to guard 1's which makes me believe he's best suited as a gunner off the bench. He's struggled with his shot this season but i'm sure he'll be adjusted to NBA range come year 2. Best comparison I could think of for him as of right now is Allen Crabbe without the length and jumpshot
This guy is going to be a top 3 NBA player one day and anyone who passes on him is going to regret it. 
Best part about him is the range.a monster in our system for sure.
Lmao ikr, ayton was a clear 4th or 5th in this sub not even a couple of months ago, i was immediately on ayton once i saw my very first highlight reel of his last year, the guy is built like a once in a generation talent, and he has the skillset to back that up.
>an un-athletic guard thats an average shooter

C'mon lol. He's a reasonably athletic (and will only get more athletic with NBA weight training) forward with a great handle, passing, and instincts. He definitely has above average shooting indicators like FT%, volume of shots and type of shots.


Point being, they're both amazing prospects and both have their flaws. I'd be ecstatic with either one but I think wing creators are just inherently more valuable than bigs these days.
I love the balls 
I love me my local balls
Oh noooooo we aren't winning. Whatsoever shall I dooo
Good
I don't understand how the grizzlies and the nets lose so many games when they have half-decent teams
I love Dennis and everything, but man Collin Sexton would be such a nice PG to have
I'm reading How to Win Friends and Influence People, and I'm trying to be a friendlier person, but I'm really struggling with the not-criticizing thing, especially when it comes to gross incompetence (like me shitting on the Grizz FO in this thread)

Someone toss some wisdom my way por favor
I can do the March madness group again if people are interested 
plus y'know, funny name. 
The fact that they fired their young coach to appease their aging star and then decided to tank anyway isn't a great look
Yeah I don't think we need to clean house or anything, and I can see the players you mentioned sticking around, but I don't really see any of them as significant contributors on a championship level team.  
Well of course if we drafted Tillie we wouldn't even need to worry about any of those other steps, we'd just instantly be the best team in the NBA -- but I was sort of working from the assumption that he'd have ascended to basketball godhood by then and would no longer be eligible to play in our mortal realm
I agree, but look at guys like TJ McConnell and Rob Covington that emerged from the dark ages for the sicers rebuild. They’re a big part of what they’re doing now. That’s my hope for those four guys. Hawks have been pretty good at developing young players so I’m glad we loaded up. 
>Cavs era

Most definitely

>Warriors era

Lol we wish
I'm pretty sure GSW also has to pay Klay too soon so at some point they're gonna have to let someone from the prime 4 go.
[Found the perfect player for you.](https://247sports.com/Player/Kofi-Cockburn-94270)
Lol but really 
Didnt someone here say they were together before the swipe right night? Conning an NBA team for a free wedding has to be in the Top 10 Most Atlanta Things Ever
Makes sense for him to play well when the team is not in contention for anything but the top pick in the draft. :)
Your precious memes! Gratefully accepted! We will need them.
I love the Hawks man lol. We've been apart of almost half of all the NBA do over games, that's so classic lmao
The best offense is a good defense imo
I especially love the Milwaukee Hawks vs Philadelphia Warriors one
I think Collins is a long-term 4 once he's more comfortable with the 3pt shot. He needs to be paired with a rim protector and he can guard 4s.
I'm a Mizzou fan so it'd be awesome getting Michael Porter Jr
i love this timeline

I’d trade Dennis if I really liked a point guard draft prospect. Like if, Schlenk forbid, we fall out of the top 5 in the draft and the only top tier guy left is Trae Young, I’d move Dennis to give the team to the rook
I’m pumped to see him play today. I get this feeling that he is about to take y’all on a legendary run. It just feels like it has to happen 
If we got Barrett I would die happy
Highly disagree. He's incredibly intelligent. People severely underrate his passing and dismiss him as a chucker.
Bingo, Trae could end up being the best player in this class, or he could be a bust. I’d rather be on either extreme than stick with Dennis who is good enough but not great
Happy Dallas won, but I do hope my Denver stepfamily can get everything clicking for the playoffs. I like those Nuggets.
I'm sure it won't happen but Brooklyn leads the Warriors at half time :P
17 more games to lose boys
Hawks lose= we win!!!!!
Man, I was actually worried we were going to win this one.
Good job Skwa
Muscala is too good.
No, he's on a 10-day contract lol
You have a better go-to movie or something?
Raptors fan here- We'll give you a loss for a win
we're gonna win this one too btw
There should be a tournament among tanking teams to determine the #1 draft pick. We would so win that shit
Beautiful tanking by coach Bud. Doing all he can to ensure a loss
nb4 we win 17 in a row and make the playoffs 
I would like to propose a trade of 10 of our wins for 10 of your losses.  Please help
Oh my god this is the best idea ever
it's ok. kent doin work
Suns -- Atlanta Clouds

Bulls -- Atlanta Matadors

Kings -- Atlanta Thomas Jeffersons

Grizzlies -- Atlanta Beartraps

Mavericks -- Atlanta Sexual Harassment Allegations

Magic -- Atlanta Muggles
Nonbelievers for magic too lmao
We r clouds lol
All good, we still have a wide selection besides those ones I mentioned. Best of luck!

My favorite post ever
Whats the original?

First and foremost the name needs to change to “RWRC Alliance”. Not tryna get fined
Nah, the Hawks, Mavs, and Grizz deserve the top 3 spots as teams that have been fighting the good fight for many years now. The Kings, Suns, and Magic have had their chances. And the Nets are losing for Cleveland so they can miss the draft all together. 
The east is pretty good this year. Although we're undefeated I'm not sure we make the playoffs.
sure

If we lose to the Kings, Bulls, and Magic, that would be nice.


It would also be nice if the Suns won against the Mavs and Kings and Magic.


Also if the Kings beat the Griz, Mavs, Magic, and Knicks


Also if the Grizz beat the Mavs, Kings, and Bulls (1x)


And if the Mavs beat the Magic and Knicks.


Too, if the Magic beat some teams.


And if the Bulls beat some teams.



Then that would be good
Hey good for you guys.
Why draft any of those guys when Tookie Brown is available?
I’m okay with Mo Bamba
Tillie? We can get Tillie. But thinking we're more likely going to end up with Bamba (not bad) rather than Ayton. 

Great picks: Ayton, Doncic
Good picks: Bamba, Porter Jr.
Decent picks: Jaren Jackson, Wendell Carter
Heartbreak: Marvin Bagley, Trae Young
Doncic is more handsomer
Don't think a shooting slump will drop him out of the top 3 but hey if we drop out I hope he does as well. 
Friendship ended with clouds

Now suicide is my best friend
These are ~~dark~~ bright times, my brothers. 
In all seriousness though: I love that Schlenk was willing to tank the season, but if we end the season without getting the bottom seed it'll be on him.

Lesson for future GMs: Don't try to get cute by signing decent vets (e.g. Dedmon/Ilyasova/Babbitt) that can maybe be flipped for second-rounders at the trade deadline. Don't try to get clever by picking up G-League guys (e.g. Taylor) who are actually pretty good and might make the difference in getting you an extra win or two. Because guess what? They might freaking GET YOU AN EXTRA WIN OR TWO.

At this point, picking up an extra second-rounder or two on the side is not what you need to be concentrating on. Picking up ancillary role players who can provide decent minutes off the bench is fool's gold.

If you're trying to draft a superstar player, your one and only priority needs to be GETTING THE TOP PICK -- and to do that, you need to clear your roster of good players who can help you win games. This isn't freaking rocket science. We should have been playing guys like Jaylen Morris 40 minutes a game throughout the entire year, and it's baffling that apparently we weren't able to figure this out.

SECURE THE TOP PICK FIRST. That's all that matters. Then *after* you've done that for a couple consecutive years, you can start filling out the rest of the roster with decent role players. Adding those guys is the easy part. Notice how they're flocking to Philly now that the Sixers actually have a core of superstars? But if you try to add decent role players first, before you've got those superstars, that's how you end up picking #9 in the draft, and never getting your franchise guy, and floating around in purgatory for a decade like the Kings.

OK, rant over. Just needed to vent. Grrr.
What is this season lmao
Honestly i know the whole tanking thing is important but this game was so much fun and i was so psyched to see us win a game like that really grinding out. Fucc outta here with that negativity. There’s lots of games for us to lose out there. Just enjoy this sliver of time after the win and enjoy it
Why did Dennis only play 23 minutes? Was he too good?
Fuck this. Honestly this is bullshit, Prince is too good for us.
The parallels between this sub and Jonestown are becoming clearer..
You can join us now if you're ready for an upgrade!
Because at the end of the day Bud is a really good coach and our players aren't playing to lose games.
Yeah I'd rather would've watched a trashfire Sixers/Bobcats style season than sit through a slightly better season (possibly) without a good return, cause let's be real - the sixth pick is great obviously but a sixth isn't necessarily gonna be much better than John Collins. We need a real star not a 'oh yeah he might become an all-star one time in 10 years' star. 
Please don't ruin our 10k subscribers surprise of the nice town we're building in the middle of the jungle that definitely won't be completely isolated from society and have armed guards.
u guys r my favorite fanbase
Don't worry brother there is a way out. But first we must uncover the Hawkspiracy. PM me for details.
Same <3
Also, we're gonna win this one, just make peace with it beforehand because it's gonna happen.
I'm more nervous about this one than I have been about some playoff games. This is a must-lose.
Jackson: "I'm better at tanking"

Prince: "No, I am"
bob just said "air plumlee" and frankly that's just disgraceful to put michael jordan in the same sentence as the great miles plumlee
Grizz fan here rooting for a Suns win.  Come on Atlanta you can do it 
Damn our first defeat of the season

I'll say that once again. Let's win as many games as possible. It doesn't even matter anymore! Just #TITS 
making sure we don't mess around and win this one
it's the best, but sir foster's organ playing more so than the sounddrops
Unpopular opinion: from what I have seen so far, I am not convinced that he is the best player in this draft. He is definitely skilled and crafty but also slow and unathletic comparing to NBA standards. Who does he defend in the NBA? His 3 point shooting is also suspect at 31%. People keep hyping up this kid because he is "young" and "dominating" the Euroleague. He is not overrated but severely overhyped, he is a top 5 talent in this year's draft but he is not better than DeAndre Ayton. 
This honestly might be a good thing he's slumping right now, because I would take him at 3/4/5 10 times out of 10. Just because he's not doing well right now doesn't mean he won't do well later. He's more than proven himself already
good argument
I am ready to live the Atlanta Hawks Civil War the day before the draft. OMG... this will be awesome.
It will be! We just need to know our position in the draft. Maybe we can make it more official.
I hope nothing comes betweens us brethren lol
No one in the top 5 is gonna give up their pick for what we have to offer, and besides, we don't even have an assured top 5 pick ourselves yet.
Honestly best way to do it if the season were to finish today... with us in the 4 spot. I’d take Trae Young and trade Dennis for a pick next year or vice versa with Michael Porter Jr. and Taurean Prince. 
i’ve watched the hawks for my whole life and i watch the nba everyday. i don’t know nothing. if you knew something then you would know that the top of this draft is as talented as it will ever be. Dennis, Taurean, and Collins is a decent core but if we could package one of them with another player or pick then we should do that in a heartbeat. we are gonna need at least two top level players with the core we have to even think about competing for titles. why not go after them in this draft? 
yeah i really love Dennis but if we had to trade him to get back in to top 5 again this draft then i am all for it. 
Lol there are only like 10 players in the world who a team with a top 5 pick would trade for and newsflash: we have none of them. There is literally no scenario in which we can trade for a top 5 pick. You really think some team is really going to want Dennis and prince for top 5 pick?! Come on man
it’s really not impossible, believe it or not. 
Ok then tell me how
well obviously you’re right that the player assets we have won’t be able to net us a top 5 pick but we also have a ton of future picks and i bet some combination of those could get you a top 5 pick IF the Hawks wanted to do that. we’ll see if they’re willing to shell out a lot for this draft. 
Competitive? ✔️

Retooling? ✔️ 

Good job Baze. 
that was the most impressive display I've ever seen from Bazemore. absolutely incredible game
 >I'm here to make a case for Michael porter jr.

Hell yeah

>he has a nice size and length where he could play the 4/5.

O no baby what is you doing
[Missouri's Cuonzo Martin: Michael Porter Jr. will play Saturday 'if he feels good'](https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/missouris-cuonzo-martin-michael-porter-jr-will-play-saturday-if-he-feels-good/)

We'll see how he looks 
Okay memes are great and fun - but please put the actual score in the post game thread titles! 

Warriors beat Hawks 114 - 109
Wow I never knew there was so many people from the bay area that live in atlanta incredible i mean they cant possibly be bandwagon fans who were born here and root for the best team to just get a cheap satisfaction so they can act like they are hot shit no that cant possibly be it
Perfect ending
Rudy Gay.
I know, we have the best mods. I mentioned Rudy Gay and my post was immediately stickied....true professionals. 
I’m pretty sure all subreddits do that
I am willing to exchange tickets for intel on the Hawkspiracy.
It is amazing how the paths of the two franchises diverted since this [game](http://www.nba.com/games/20150206/GSWATL/gameinfo.html).
I feel like Collins is going to have a good game tonight. Hopefully not TOO good
Skwa... tonight is a beautiful night to remain competitive while retooling! Lelelelet's gooooooooo
Shit you're not supposed to win this Hawks
Clouds are very high in the sky
Say now you take his contract and give it to Air Plumlee... That makes more sense 
That was one of the most fun games I've ever seen as a Hawks fan of 28 years.

Philips was absolutely electric that night.
lol like 40% chance we magically blow them out
If we win this one 86 that 1st pick (probably).

Not far from the truth.. Sometimes I get high and just watch highlights of all the top prospects
Brilliant!!!!

Are we sure it's a permanent change?
Can't do Hawks bro. Celtic Al is greatest Al of all-time (closely followed by Home Improvement Al).
With Ersan gone there's no one else lol
I'm cool with that..... so look, if you could just show me where the door is I'll let myself out....
Go back to the front page and hit that button up top that says “unsubscribe”
We trade all of our 2018 picks to move up in the draft to as high as we can. Who knows who would take it, but it might make our chances better
JJJ still there? Take him. Otherwise take a bet on Bagley or Young as much as I'm not high on them right now. Bamba could still be good as well. 
Draft Knox or Sexton and be happy. Let's just hope we get #1 or #2 tho. 
Klay Thompson and it’s not close. 

Baze is a solid defender with good energy. But Klay is remarkably sound and extremely smart on the defensive end. 
I will never not upvote this video

Also suck it Celtics no decade straight of chips for you!
As I was watching this a trout sandwich appeared in the place of my laptop and now I'm typing this on a sandwich hope it reaches you guys cool bye
I sure am glad we traded down from the #2 pick (guaranteed top-5 at least) to the #5 pick (possibly as low as #8) tonight. That win definitely means more to the future of our franchise than getting a high draft pick would.

*EDIT: Actually Phoenix won tonight so we would have had the #1 draft seed (guaranteed top-4), not the #2 seed. GOOD THING WE DODGED THAT BULLET.
Forget it, knowing our luck, we weren't gonna get the top 3 picks anyways...
We are too good to get the #1 pick. We're the best team in the tank race imo
Let it go!! Let's try to win any game. We will probably lose most of them, because teams are fighting Playoffs. We will end with 22-24 wins. That's enough for a top 5 pick.
Yeah y'all have some promising players for sure with Lavine and Markannen, adding the right lottery pick will bring you to sp00ky territory. I would say Phoenix does as well with Josh Jackson and Devin Booker.
Clouds block out the sun. The suns are in last place and we must block them from getting the top pick
Personally I think discarded jet fuel tanks are the best bet for incapacitating bears. https://gizmodo.com/5993796/russian-bears-are-hooked-on-huffing-jet-fuel-until-they-pass-out. 

The Atlanta Jet Fuel Tanks has a nice ring to it.
Yeah, I didn't like that show and that made me dislike it more.
On the bright side, someone also has to win
Yeah no doubt that Millsap would be an amazing mentor for him.  But I think what we did was best long term
I'd rather have Ayton, more upside, and it gives us one of the best young big men combos in the league.
Okay I will charge it now
you guys remember last year, when we had millsap, and the objective was to win, and we did that a bunch and it was fun and more than five people actually watched the games. 

yeah good times. 
Will the Pacers please play some defense..WTF.  This is embarrassing for both teams.  We can't tank right and the Pacers getting blown out by the Hawks.
damn, a loss would be nice here. the race for the first pick is really close. if we continue to win we can easily fall out of the top 5 range, which would be a major fuck up for the season
We about to grab that last playoff spot and win it all. Clouds are parting, it was a ploy the entire time. 
we need to find a way to make bud sit out for the rest of the season. he is way too good of a coach for tanking purposes
Collins and prince look like they have some chemistry. Next year should be more fun
DEAD AS DORNAIL ASS THREAD MY G....Love the Cloud factory. Forgive me 4 my Ignorance but just why do they/we call it the Cloud Factory. Highlight factory was fire. is it b cause were Hawks and we fly in clouds?
that would actually make sense

You guys are the Cawks. Much better joke.
Easy give me 100 cloud sized hawks
I like watching this team more tbh
putting on one of the greatest tank come back performances ever.  Its magical.
OMG...that was funny. I feel like i got Rick Rolled
But Cawk is another word for penis. And PENIS it’s a funny word.
HAHAHAHAHA I TOTALLY DIE LMAO I WAS PROLLY STONED AS SHIT HAHASHAHHAHAH THATS GREAT.
DOOD PENIS, CAWK, WHATEVER U WANNA CAL IT. LOL
HAHHAHHAHHAHA i could if i would got dang man that was a brain meltdown of epic proportions lol.
Sweet niblits 
Lol bet
We’re coming in full force
Hey man u right u right
But it’s perfectly timed to block the suns 
U hear that as well? Glad I'm not the only one sheesh 
tis' been the Achilles heel of the hawks for many a decade. 
That's a cool name, we should make a basketball team with that name 
I love following this subreddit, you guys are so wacky and zany with your basketball fundamentalism.

That boy Taylor is QUICK
Great uniforms tonight.
That's like all he does nowadays lol
That's my point lol
Plumdog just goaltended Bazemore's shot from going in. This is advanced tanking.
Can we get a vid of that beautiful tanktend by PlumGod
IT is overrated as fuck...Happy Death Day was EASILY the best horror movie of 2017
We have the best IT on the court tonight 
Atlanta Clouds already better meme than undefeated
the twist ending was amazing tbh
Right? How did that kid get this gig?
Holy shit man I couldn't make it through half the song lmao that chorus had my sides obliterated. This is borderline satire lol
I liked the Lakers. I hate most laker fans cuz let's admit it, it's a popular team/Kobe bandwagon. Literally all Lakers fans I know irl are. But that's just me. And I liked the actual team, I want lonzo to become a star
Hey, thanks for sharing your experience. It’s good to know I’m not alone. What a weight off my shoulders...

When I was a small child, I’d often have a nagging feeling that I was actually Joe Johnson. Odd, I know, but that feeling still persists today - “You are Joe Johnson... you are!” 

Now, I’m ready to sprout my wings. Reading these cloud facts has made me want to go out and fulfill my Johnson-esque legacy. I will fly - this, I can guarantee. Ca-caw!
with that kind of nihilism he'll fit right in
In German there is a saying that is quite fitting:

Tu einfach so als wenn es dieses Sprichwort gäbe.

This is roughly translated to:

Existence is pain, welcome to the Hawks

Today, there are a bunch of Germans that are Hawks fans and/or Mav fans...that must be a special kind of hell.
Maybe, but “Feeling nothing” and “just want to be out of college” seems more personal than “excited about the nba” or whatever generic response. 
Yeah I agree. Over analyzing stuff like this hardly ever ends up meaning anything. If coaches are good with his attitude/motivation after pre-draft process, that’s all that matters. 
Yes Rudy Gay would make us an instant contender 
I feel like the team is still to young to make a push for the playoffs. Veteran leadership is important to winning I just don’t think after one top 3 pick that the hawks would be in a position to start competing. 
You ain't gettin' my lil Rudy (<3) as long as I live.
Not a problem brotato chip, trust me you're helping us more than we might be helping you 😏

I've been trusting the process for y'all for a couple of years now and I'm just happy to see it FINALLY coming together. I fully believe in ben and Embiid. They are legitimately going to be the new kings of the east after LeBron, not the Celtics. That blend of straight up generational talent with the popavichian flair of Brett brown is going  to be incredible to behold. I think there's a very real reason they BOTH chose y'all over the rest of the teams. 

Philly has been really coming alive this year in the sports world, it makes me believe that Atlanta hopefully is on its way. 
Absolutely agreed! May the lottery balls be in your favor!
I laughed at your local radio. Whatever station Ike Reese is on . They were nearly freaking out at the beginning like OMG THEY DIDNT WIN ENOUGH. I was in the area at the time 
Fultz will be better than CP3
Idk I think Doncic and Ayton are in a tier of their own. JJJ’s great on defense but I feel like he’s on the same level as Bagley, MPjr, Bamba, etc
You're absolutely correct!
Also, Cloud flair is now available.

1. JJJ
2. Doncic
3. MPJ
4. Ayton
5. Young

JJJ has passed Doncic on my board. In my opinion he's the safest player in this class, even above Luka. 6'11, elite 7'4 wingspan, fluid athlete, outstanding rim protection and instinct, can shoot threes and run the floor. He has potential to be one of the very best defenders in the NBA. I just feel like we're going to be in the lottery for 2-3 years and it's not a bad idea to get an extremely safe prospect with tantalizing defensive upside who will fit in our system and anchor our defense for a decade. Also would make for a superb pairing with Collins on paper. 

I'm not as high on Ayton as everyone else. He's an indifferent defender, low motor and has no defensive instinct. There's a possibility he could be another Okafor. Offensive centers with low DBPM have a poor recent record in the league. 
Ayton has significantly better measurables and is a much better athlete than Okafor. Plus I have enough faith in Bud to get almost anyone to play decent defense. 
The thing with JJJ is that he didn't start out that high so he has to overcome existing biases. Luka has been a consensus elite prospect for years. Ayton established himself as a #1 contender from the get go at Arizona. But JJJ has made tremendous leaps in development and a strong case can be made that he's now the best prospect. 

I've already mentioned that he has ridiculous defensive upside and that he's shooting 43 percent from deep on good volume, but he also has potential as a facilitator and he has enough handle and mobility to receive a pass on the perimeter and drive it and score in a flash. He just seems like he has unicorn potential. There's shades of Anthony Davis in his game. I've preferred Doncic all along and I would still be ecstatic if we drafted him, but after reading analyses on Jackson from scouts I trust and watching his highlights, I feel like he's become the best prospect for me. 
You are just nitpicking on Ayton's weaknesses and making excuses for Young's weaknesses at this point lol.
We all have different opinions, we can talk and argue all day about who is better, but the answer will reveal itself once they play in the NBA.
You’re walking a fine line of being secretly happy about this.
If they win a bit more than a third of their games (7-13) then the Clippers would only need to go 13-11 to pass them. I don't expect it to happen, but it could definitely get dicey. 
Those Indiana jerseys are clean af
Just popping in from the Hornets sub, which has undergone both Bee Movie and Star Wars Prequel meme phases this season to cope with our crippling depression and perpetual mediocrity, to ask how you beautiful cicadas are doing. 
Hi I am a scout of the Atlanta Hawks, we currently have a roster spot available, you can send me your highlight tapes, your name, your age and your height. Thanks.
Okay first question: 

Favorite go-to movie?
u can email them to travis at tits@gmail.com. good luck what type of contract are you looking for 
I missed my gay dad
What are your thoughts on him getting married?
300 shots a day in practice from hear on out for the rest of the year. Small break in the off season than we up that to 500 a day for the off season. Should be good to go.
Let the rook learn on the job.  Its good for the tank too.
If you read the article, definitely sounds like bud wants him to shoot it more
Awww drat!
They win more, we lose more. Makes sense for both teams 
Mmmm... that sexy grin
Damn that's a shit ton of money. Cubans not having a good time rn at all
Yeah but Giannis wasnt a top pick. And I hope it doesnt happen but Ayton could still turn out to be an Okafor. I know OP said top 10 protection (which is also why the Grizz wouldnt agree to this) but giving our own pick away during a rebuilding period isnt a smart move.
"Enjoy the hawks in this years tankapolooza as they aren't garunteed to be back for a while." 

The future is bright my guys
Ayton is still the best IMO.
First time I've seen this meme format.
As soon as the college season started Ayton over took him. Bagley has the athleticism and the physical qualities but seems to be somewhat lacking in the skills department for a top pick.
I know the segment, I watch the show from time to time. Just surprised to see the Upvote Factory using creative meme formats. That wasn't blasphemy, was it?
I literally am watching the latest episode. I got home from work and it was on my YouTube suggested videos. 
* He's not falling outside of top 10

* Smart defensive player (even more impressive considering he's one of the youngest in this class) with tools to be DPOY. Gets blocks naturally without getting out of position, slides his feet well.  

* Shot looks projectable, good 3PT% but more importantly his FT% has been in the high 70s for a few years now (high school) which is more of an indicator for how pure a shooter someone is.

* Feel offensively is so so. Will likely never be able to get his own shot (not to mention create for others), mostly spot up 3pt/attack closeout/putback guy.

* Marquese Chriss potential. Will always be a smarter player on both ends, but you're banking on his willingness and ability to improve (mostly) offensive awareness. Averages 5.7 fouls per40. What if his shot (low release point and jumps forward, easier to block with NBA defenses) doesn't translate or is only functional when left wide open? 

* [This is one play is absolutely terrifying.](https://twitter.com/robdauster/status/955651365656817664) I haven't seen him do anything close to that since, and you don't want to put few flashes over substantial sample size of this not being there, but it's something. If his shake displayed in this instance ever gets consistent, 3PT shot translates and defensive production maintains (probably safest of all his skills), we're looking at a Draymond on steroids minus the passing.


I'd have him in the 3-6 range. Just feel like prospects like Doncic/Young/MPJ come around less often and even if they're more likely to bust, you have to take that chance with where we are and how valuable primary initiators are in today's league. I'd feel way more comfortable if Jackson showed he can at least get his own more than once in a blue moon.
Lmao he's not going that late... I'd take him #5 if I'm the Hawks and Doncic, Trae, Ayton, MPJ are gone. I'd be very happy with Jackson. He's an outstanding fit next to John Collins 
I'd consider taking him #1. He'd be a perfect fit next to Collins.
He grabbed that rebound that one time real good
A true legend 
He has played pretty well, a decent 3 point threat and good acceleration. I prefer him over Bembry
Looking like his floor will be 3 point specialist which is good. If your second rounder develops into any type of serviceable player it's a good pick 
He's a rookie this year. But he's looking good in Spurs east
Yep you're right, for some reason I thought we drafted him along with Prince. Then him having this success as a rookie is even more impressive. I hope he stays with the Hawks for a long time
sure but that eurostep tho
Culture 2 is good af tho 
It's too long is what it is. But it's got some good songs on it.
Oh okay. I might then
I make it a point to myself to not get too hyped on rookies, but he is efficient af and athletic af right now. He's still got a nice handful of areas he needs to improve on, we'll really know what we have on our hands come next year when we see what he does during offseasons
It’s not about the dunks. It’s the fact that he’s one of the most efficient players in the league 
will do, thanks! 
The dunks are nice tho
And it's not like boban-style fluke efficiency, it's good ball handling and finishing that would fit into a modern team. 
I think he’s saying John Collins has the potential to be one of the all time great Filipino league players, similar to Ivan Johnson.
I miss Ivan. He's an urban legend of sort.

*it is said that he once accumulated 6 fouls at once, just by raising one great eyebrow to a ref.*
This is believable tbh
Proud of our boys. 
Pretty sure the Migos are a package deal
Only if we also get Win Butler for the unstoppable /r/indieheads & 
 /r/hiphopheads backcourt
Migos a better package deal than the ball brothers. 
What an incredible experience
What did SoundCloud do to deserve that kind of treatment?
Oh cool, someone else who uses Play Music
glad you made an account for this post
GOOD GOD ALMIGHTY GOOD GOD ALMIGHTY THAT JUST KILLED HIM!
This was better than 90% of the dunks in the dunk contest
we wouldn’t get a top 5
Well, I say no because I just got a jersey for him, but even looking for a pick, you could never touch the top 5 with Schroder. Maybe if he was more versatile, if he was a good shooter along with his skill set, then he might be worth a top 5 pick
Point guard is probably the deepest position in the league. There are at least 15 point guards who are better than Denis, so there's no way we're touching the top 5 in this trade climate if he's the centerpiece of the deal.
Will Quavo fall out of the top 5
You answered your own question
For real. I think he could absolutely be a starter on a good team
He's just a little lanky for my liking. NBA is going towards more of a stretch 5, but I prefer more bulk on my centers. 
He would start over Zaza and TT right now
This guy's super dense
The plan is very simple

 * Retool while Remaining Competitive

 * Draft a Generational Talent

 * Tool while Remaining Competitive

 * Overpay in Free Agency

 * Win 3+ consecutive NBA Titles

 * Underpay in Free Agency/Recruit Aging Kevin Durant

 * Win more Titles, at least one 82-0 Season

 * Atlanta sports legacy cemented, coinciding with Multiple Super Bowls, several World Series Wins, and 17 MLS Cups
Getting a top 3 pick would help. Then focusing on developing the younger guys. 
Insert Bud's proud dad face.
I know the majority of people love Doncic but I really think Ayton is the PERFECT fit for the Hawks. A 7 footer that has range, can play D, has an elite post game. I just came thinking about him and Collins terrorizing the NBA together for the next 15-20 seasons. 
>77


Nice.
>What does Atlanta Hawks need to become a Playoff Contender?

one to three more years of tanking lol
Rockets' pick: Impossible
Twolves' pick: Best case scenario is Taurean Prince

I am fine with that though. Our best bet is our first picks in the next 1-3 years. 
i've graduated in november and have been doing nothing but applying for jobs since lol it fucking sucks
>get the mods of this sub to run the actual team 

lol we can barely run this sub, it takes me half a week to overcome my laziness to update the scores on the top bar
Bruh you're a mod of r/AtlantaHawks. So you're right, you've been doing nothing.


Lolol jk, I know that feel all too. I'm working a shitty wage job rn to keep myself afloat until an opportunity comes.


What is your industry? 
I could give two shits about your parking lot. I'm excited for the team.
What aspect of marketing? I'm in marketing analytics so I might be able to give you some pointers
I'm mostly applying to general (junior) marketing & communications employee positions, but also some copywriting, online marketing and content management stuff. 
Ah okay, can't help you too much there. Best of luck!
Yeah guys, obviously the best part about him is that he is completely devoid of talent at this point
I didn’t watch. Is he actually good?
Greatest Hawk of all time
He could develop pretty alright. Not a player for a not tanking team yet but he's had a nice debut 
White looked nice tonight. Dude has a great shot. Was happy to see him on the floor tonight. 

Also the Baptist saw 30 mins! 

Great comeback after going down 30 and the boys did a great job showing that we REMAIN COMPETITIVE WHILE RETOOLING. 
I'm a Syracuse fan and you guys have a great player. Man I loved watching Andrew in the year we had him. Wish we could've had him longer honestly.
Homeless man's klay maybe lol
Good shooter that can provide scoring off the bench 
Probably 9 feet. Most ceilings are 9 feet nowadays. 
True. Is he on the roster for the rest of the year?
Winning, hopefully
All hope of ever winning an NBA championship? 
ah yes love too gowbthevundefeated 
put bazemore back in, were too good
Bulls fan stopping in. You guys are dominating this tank. I’m impressed. 
Now, the Pistons are just dicking on the Hawks.  RIP.  Beautiful tank. 
wowww. if dedmon were out too it would be our death line up. we should be saving that for better teams like the suns and kings
Tony Hawks Boom Boom Huck Jam was the defining moment of my childhood. I'm so glad someone else remembers it
Yes!! That's exactly what it was! Thank you.
We're on the right track boys
For the greater good
unironically the best IT in the league 
Rudy Gay
LeBron James and Kevin Durant would be nice. 
Some more of those sweet sweet Cash Considerations 
Nice, I haven't even heard of a couple of these guys. Looking forward to checking them out.
We will have to attach stuff (picks, Collins, Prince) to get rid of him but since doing that would only make sense if we have a commitment from better players in free agency (which won't happen) we won't move him. Gotta eat those remaining 2.5 years, then splurge in 2020 before it's time to extent Prince.
We're not gonna be good again before his contract runs out anyway so we just ride it out.
knowing our luck we'll also have the third best record through the remaining games too
Please cut Ilyasova (because he's too good) and bench Dedmon, I do not want to end up #3 then get miraculously pushed down to 5 because the Knicks and Cavs need to be top 3. 
 Good... very good
Good, good... 
Nothing better to start my morning than #TITS and ham talk
1. Draft Doncic
2. Trade Dennis + 2 late 1st round picks + whatever else for another lottery pick
3. Draft best available rim-protecting center (Bamba plz) at whatever pick we get
4. Win the draft
IT MEANS HE REALLY WANTS TO DRAFT THE ONE TRUE DAD, DEANDRE AYTON
EXACTLY
best news I've heard in a long time
God his jumper looks hideous.  But so beautiful.  Like his soul.
If killian tillie isn’t available then sure
If your argument is based on 2K it's already not very convicing. Also the trade deadline has passed lol
Olaf you are wrong

My haiku skills are flawless

Just like the Knicks tank

The Squared Circle mods need to show more respect to my boy. #EliasIsNotAMeme
They will probably be a Playoffs team. Their core allows them to build on it and bring another valuable piece. Don't forget that they will also get a good rookie this season thanks to Nets' pick. 
Truely a ludicrous display tonight
We are really gonna win too many games and pick 8th and watch Doncic, Young, MPJ, Bagley, Ayton, Bamba, Bridges and Sexton all be gone and we end up with some bullshit bust lol.
Great Game. Ish Smith's passing really carried us today.

Side note: It'll be hilariously Hawks-esque if this win was the one that kept us out of the Top 5.
Thanks for beating the pistons, wish you guys the best of luck for the rest of the year
Do you guys prefer winning or tanking?

Btw I love the Harry the Hawk that appears on your comments section, visited other team reddit sites and you guys are the only ones that have that.
You should list it as 118-115... Hawks score always first. I had to read more comments to figure out if you were just memeing the title or not.
The Hawks record is so shit now that I've been able to actually enjoy games.  It's been good to my blood pressure.
>end up with some bullshit bust lol.


Well if those names are gone then we could still end up with whichever Bridges you weren't talking about or Jaren Jackson. Both would be great picks.
I get disappointed when I watch most away/other team games because no one is as good as him, lol.
just hand off the tanking power, you guys are done with it so its nice to share with others
It doesn't matter. We're gonna win some games and I'm gonna be happy to see the guys pick up a win. Still want that top pick of course but I'm not panicking if we beat an absolutely lethargic Pistons team who practically gave it away.
Lose to Magic and we gucci!
Dafuk we need better shitposts
The Atlanta Hawks are the hope of the universe. 

The Atlanta Hawks are the answer to all living things that cry out for peace.

The Atlanta Hawks are truth. 

Ally to good! Nightmare to you!
Eeehhhhhh this is pretty shitty
Lol no
This whole Dedmon situation pisses me off. This dude is a straight beast, he’s really good. And Miles freaking Plumlee was starting over him for 20 plus games. It’s just unacceptable. He could’ve been putting up these numbers all season. We could’ve got a first rounder for him!
you guys have hot cheerleader with couldnt-be-shorter dress.
We're good to win aren't we 
Lol
I was always partial to a good SWKAH everyone once and a while
Milk chocolate of course is the most popular but dark chocolate is my favorite. 
Al Horford is a fan favorite 
Dwight was actually my favorite player before he played here, and still is. I got my jersey signed by him when he played us at home Jan 31st, and he signed it with a #8 which I thought was cool 
I’m gonna tell everyone that you still wear it. Enjoy your chat ban. 
Not with the top 3 pick:


1.Killian Tillie 


2.DeAndre Ayton


3.Luka Doncic
I think we're for the most part not about getting Trae because we have Dennis anyway really
L.A.M.P.


Lose a lot


And


Make sure to win the lottery for the #1



Pick, Luka Doncic

Most wolves weigh about 40 kilograms but the heaviest wolf ever recorded weighed over 80 kilograms!
FUN FACT FOR YA
A wolf can run at a speed of 40 miles per hour during a chase. Wolves have long legs and spend most of their time trotting at a speed of 7-10 miles per hour. They can keep up a reasonable pace for hours and have been known to cover distances of 55 miles in one night.

That Korver kid is pretty good. Should’ve scooped him up at the deadline 
Prince went 0-9 from 3? LMAO
Good guy Kyle out here making us all winners.
if we get ths 7th pick somehow. Sure.
Now there is a roster spot for Georgios Papagiannis, that was waived by the Kings! Would love to give him a chance and all Plumlee's minutes! A young prospect under Coach Bud's guidance. DO IT!
Better than buying out. Better than expected. I thinked to myself "yes"
Good bot.  I feel much better now. 
Are we one of the contenders interested? 
Good thing they got some value out of him
We're free. 
okay i concede that as well, but what it all really boils down to in the long run is, whos name is more fun to say? Marco Belenelli? or Tyler Dorsey?  
Annnnnd the Cavs are still favored by 2.
When we said Isaiah Taylor was the best IT in the NBA we were just joking. But now I’m not so sure 
Well they have this guy called LeBron James who is apparently good at basketball.
Lol damn, I just figured tickets would be cheap since there’s only like 4 players available to play for the Cavs tonight. 

Guess expensive tickets are the price you gotta pay for seeing an undefeated hawks team
u get what u pay for baby, top tier ATL hawks basketball. 

#truetoatlanta
So if I voluntarily pay more for a ticket we'll have a better team?
Is he the new Mike Scott? I know Mike Scott is irreplaceable but he's doing his best

Welcome to the “Lockheed Martin Close Combat Tactical Trainer” Center.

Don’t look that up.  It’s definitely not a training system for tanks.


If Amazon comes here, this is most likely.
[tfw u had a more productive night than Schlenk](https://i.imgur.com/C4AZaAC.png)
Just waived Sheldon Mac. It’s like they don’t even care about a good meme.
Dedmon and Bellinelli should not be Hawks right now
Honestly starting to lose faith in TS. He hasn't really made a great deal yet. The Collins pick was great though. 
Buyout Ersan and Marco and I’ll be happy. Would’ve liked assets , but getting worse is the different between Ayton and like Miles Bridges
Beli was hoodwinked lmao
 
nice sidebar btw
Probably most teams knew that we'd just buy them out and wanted to wait and get them for free.
He is saying we got Sheldon Mac basically for free. 
Wiz wanted to clear a roster spot, we got cash along with him.

Hard to trade away players when the potential buyout market could be one of, if not the, best ever. Lot of good veterans out there... better than those we had to offer
Mods, sticky this post. This is an important question that will determine the future of our lives for many years to come
I love tits
We've come full circle Nique
What’s the over/under on how many times Nique will call him Shelvin Mack if he stays 
Mac is out this season with an achilles injury btw, lol. 
Lol we have 5 point guards 
We are in a space time continuum 
60 win season at incoming 
That makes this hurt even more. Oh well
Ok,  I missed that part.  The second tweet said that we sent them cash.
ew barely saved any money lol this was the most pointless of trades ever 
welcome to hawks basketball, where nothing exciting ever happens

I'm sure Ressler's wallett disagrees
Shabazz is still available. Quick bby - you got 3 mins!
Dedmon would re-sign if we pay him what he's worth. Still don't understand what Schlenk is thinking keeping Bellinelli.
haha #relatable!
Are you sure about that? Because I am 100.0% sure that duhpolan is not a bot.

Remember when we lost to the Heat when they had like 9 guys available? And we were actually a "good" team?
Buyout is strong possibility with Dedmon. Belli I haven't heard much. 
We're going to win to begin our playoff run. 
Okaro White lol, Cmon Marc Spears
Farewell sweet watermelon
Clears some cap-space, tank move, Okaro is younger, so might be good for the future.
or rose to utah!
Or Rose to waivers
I chose the team too, I live in Pittsburgh and they don't have an NBA team so I picked a team like 5 years ago and have stuck with them. Even tho we are tanking and its a losing season, its fun to watch the talent come together, it will be rewarding at the end.
I was born and raised a Hawks,Falcons,bulldogs fan. 

Welcome to the team that will always disappoint but at least you know we aren’t bandwagon jumpers
Being a hawks fan is fun af welcome to the show 
I think these next few seasons will be great for Atlanta fans. Travis has landed us some key 1st round picks we could either trade up for or try to find more talent in this draft class along with our lottery pick. Atlanta's a growing city and might be the site of Amazon's new headquarters. When we start to come up, I think we'll be able to recruit stars to create a winning basketball culture.
Happy to be a part.
There’s a lot more risk trading for a bunch of declining 32 year olds than an improving 26 year old
apparently, if we trade for Rudy Gay we will have like 5 wins for the season. Amazing.
ok u got it
Winnings fun and all....until we play ourselves out of the Top 3 picks and take Trae Young
Will always be a legendary video 
Is he available for a 10-day contract? He could help us in our retooling efforts, and I'd love to see him back on Atlanta even if he still wants to chuck shots up. He was a visionary.
Would love to see him play with Collins. Imagine the dunk contests in practice
do we lose 6 first rounders?
I love how every team loses in this trade lol.
Why tank one team when you can tank the whole conference!
did we package Magic City in the trade???
lol, everybody loses.
I have a feeling that absolutely nothing is gonna happen lol. We're gonna have to buy all the old people out.
well we had a willy, which sounds pretty close. but we just traded him for kobe bryant and two first rounders
If you are by yourself you should be able to move up to courtside 
That's a good tip right there! Thursday night game cant imagine it'll be packed.
I think that’s great, but the Hawks should let him know he’d be staying for the rest of the season (no buyout).
I was pretty annoyed when I heard about this -- like, why did we sign him in the first place if we weren't going to be able to trade him? But judging from the quotation in the article, it sounds like he's actually open to the idea, he just wants to see what all his options are first. Hopefully we can find a trade that makes everybody happy.
Because there’s a chance we buy him out and he gets money, and gets to pick where he’s going. The plan was always to lose him by the deadline and let JTB/Babbit/Cavanaugh get more PT
Yooo Dorsey with 10 pts 7 assists 2 steals and 0 TURNOVERS? Someone's happy about the Belinelli news
I love Dennis Schroder
good try u lil turds!!! 
It is top ten protected meaning we aren’t getting it 
top 10 in 2019 and 2020
1.Lebron ain’t staying.
2. They are shit even with him. Like even we have been better in 2018 and have won 3 more games than them since christmas. Are you telling me a team that is in the playoffs by 3.5 games with the best player in the world (and even that is propped up by a huge win streak) isn’t bottom 10 without him, you’re crazy.

Now what I have heard tossed around is the Hawks taking the Cavs bad contracts in exchange for making the pick unprotected 
Dedmon's contract is amazingly cheap tho.
No one in their right minds would take Plumlee cuz it's not like we're packaging picks with him
He has a player option and some teams want him for more than just a year.
its most likely marco for rudy gay and a lottery pick
Any chance at all we get a first lol
 Nah but we get more Dorsey and get possible trade ammo or developmental talent 
According to one of our best writers, there’s talk of Shabazz for Beli.

Could definitely see us shed a 2nd rounder to help bolster our shooting 
I highly doubt we get that for Marco. He’s not that good of a player 
Best 3 point shooter ever fight me
Don't think the Bucks are interested in Marco specifically but I would love to swindle Wilson away from them, they don't play him anyway and I'm sure Bud can turn him into something useful.
We did, it's /u/JarydWilson.

But with the shitpost-factor of this sub I think it's gonna be tough to get more 'official' contact. You never know though, and I'm sure we'll get more AMA's and stuff in the future, but those are easier to schedule in the off-season.
Nice haul. 

I don't even mind losing Prince for Gordon Heyward.

And Zaza is the cherry on top.
Fun Fact: /u/Wong-A-Donger is the fourth best mod in Cobb County.
That's an amazing fact! Wow! The Hawks are really showing the rest of the NBA teams in Georgia how to get it done!
Damn deleted the first thread 
Fun fact.
I'd say yeah, he's the most complete two way player we have on this roster. Dennis is obviously the far superior talent but that doesn't make him a better player. He only plays on one side of the court and is wildly inconsistent. No surprise that his trade value is only worth a 1-17 protected pick
If by best you mean worst, yes. I think Dennis Shroder Is the best, most consistent. Harry the Hawk is a close 2nd though.
I agree with this and I personally prefer him over Ayton because he does it on both ends of the floor. With his length, three point shot, and defensive upside, he would make for a potentially superb pairing with Collins. Also he's the youngest player in the draft. 
I commented #TrustInTravis on Collins' insta pic, and tre Kirby liked it. I'm basically famous, ama
JC is the best
Can we stop being competent at basketball, k thnx 
Can someone tell me the song that sir foster just played? (1:40ish in the second) Ik its a popular song but i cannot remeber it for the life of me
We are feeling a lot better now tho. 
Fun fact: the bayhawks are actually one of the best teams in the g league this year
I like John Collins.

I enjoy watching John Collins. It is my favorite player.

When he dunks, I think to myself "yes".

When he passes, I think to myself "no".

Honestly it makes sense, (practically) everyone's got a price. I don't think we're like actively shopping guys like TP  but if the right trade comes along...
You right 
Mitchell and Simmons are so unbelievably good man, but still for a 19th pick we've lucked out. God, can you imagine this season without my beautiful bouncy boy. 
CC: Coach Bud

According to this he is the 3rd best rookie. 
I think he would grade out higher if he got more minutes
I think he is going under he radar and is actually pretty good
I'm pretty sure bud has been steadily increasing his minutes since the start of the year, so I think he knows lol
3rd best? Really? He’s much closer to the average line than Tatum. 
Probably means we'd win more games 
Could we package the Minny and Houston picks to move up in the draft? We have pieces we can give up to get another late 1st round pick. Ideally we could be in a position to get a top 3, a top 15, and 25 or under.
Dennis, Bazemore, and Minnesota first for Jr Smith Tristan Thompson and the Brooklyn first 
Why would the warriors do that? Young is definitely better than Marco
And Rudy Gay is the guy you get as your star?
how the hell do you think this would be a good trade for us
If we got Gordon we'd be back to where we were when snek was here... undersized and getting out rebounded which was a huge flaw in the 60-win team that teams capitalized on
Probably not this week that's more a trade that you do on draft night but it's definitely an option then. 
I'm hesitant to give up any picks in that deal. We can swap it out for Dedmon, since he's on the block anyway and fills a huge need for CLE. We'll suck anyway, so let's just collect picks. We'll take the salary.
Yes, however we'll have to do it with our 2022 first instead of our 2018 first.  
Oh my sweet summer child
Rudy Gay is a superstar in this league 
Lmao you can call Dallas up, Seth’s available 
Ok
I think we forget that having 4 all-stars on a championship team (including two top 3/4 players) is far from the norm and that it will all even out once the Warriors eventually fall apart. 

Dennis can easily be a starter and 3rd/4th option on a championship team if we draft two all-star caliber talents in the next two seasons (big if, I know), John Collins keeps improving and we attract a good free agent or two. In four years you could have a line-up of: Experienced veteran Dennis / Star Draftee shooter / Borderline all-star Prime Prince or a top FA SF /  24 year old John Collins / Star drafted Center. 

Now this is all best case scenario of course but remember that last year we could've gone a lot farther in the Playoffs had Dwight and THJ not completely collapsed. 


If hes the third option on a team, absolutely. However, he'll have to go to a team that will be able to mask his defensive flaws. Somewhere like San Antonio would be ideal for him.
That'll sure help their Defensive issues
Good question
Probably the most important sporting event of the day. Wild finish
I genuinely love how most of our Knicks games end with controversy and new york salt
I'm pretty salty about how the Knicks aren't tanking against all the teams that aren't the Hawks. 
No joke his trade value is probably at an all time high right now. I don't want to trade him, but I also can't think of a reasonable trade for us and another team to take him either
Lol what is this? I was just memeing 
Sadly Schröder is Not at His best ^^
Let's hope he doesn't Killian you. Or better yet maybe we hope he does
I’m sure we will see a change by next Friday 
[I don’t think this deserves its own thread so I’ll stick it here.](https://twitter.com/stevekylerNBA/status/960182195548753920?s=17) 

My heart would poop it’s pants if that deal happened

Well Picks and young talent. If we can swindle some lottery picks that teams aren't using for cheap (Wilson) we should absolutely be going after that.
Two top ten picks with ammo to move up even farther? That’s a dream
Id honestly just rather keep Dennis, but baze + <insert any number of players not named Taurean Prince or John Collins here>  for nets pick, TT, and shump could definitely work
I think Dennis would be an upgrade over IT. I mean, IT is capable of putting up 29 a night but he's not fully healthy right now, and the Cavs, I feel, are growing impatient with his progress. Schroder isn't Kyrie Irving, but he's playing way better than IT at this moment. Kent would be another upgrade over JR because Baze is very energetic and his defense is really good too. 
Giving up something like Baze+Dedmon for the nets pick would be beautiful
I would be okay giving up Marco and even our second rounder/other first in this situation to sweeten it too. I think we should really try to exhaust all reasonable options to getting it
So beautiful there is a 0% chance the cavs do it
Idk how two ways work but we’d probably cut Magette and White even tho I love Magette and want to keep him. Maybe Taylor instead?
Lmao. This is the best sub in the nba! I always a get a laugh from your posts. 

My wife was talking about some random thing - I don’t know, curtains or toothbrushes or something - when I saw this and had to choke back laughter, so she wouldn’t know I wasn’t paying attention to whatever she was talking about. 
OK daddy 💧
amazing
This is some hype shit, truly amazing, well done!
Shoot like young, pass like Doncic, tall like Porter, high energy like Bagley and better defense than Ayton. If the team with the number 1 pick doesn't take him, it will be a huge mistake.
Is Killian Tillie the next Rudy Gay?
I think Philips is pretty nice.  Good seats pretty much all around, except in the 400s (which I'm pretty sure they don't have even open right now) and if you're in the 200s on the sides of the court above row G there's an overhang that is kinda in the way.  I'm a big fan of the taco place.  They're expensive, of course, and I don't recall the name of the place, but get the steak tacos.  They're unruly but delicious.  Other people are right -- if you wanna save $$, eat at CNN Center food court beforehand.  There's a Taco Mac connected to Philips if you want actually good beer, or you can find a place in the food court that does like 24 oz beers for $7 (as I recall), which is a pretty good pregame option.  Also, as others have suggested, there is cheaper parking, but for me, the CNN deck is the best parking.  It's right across the street.  Again, it's expensive and yeah, it will take a while to get out of it to drive home, but that's most anywhere.  Also, I recommend going early as that area gets slammed with Hawks traffic AND non-Hawks traffic.  Taking MARTA to the game is also a decent option, or use MARTA there/Lyft home or something, especially if you're drinking.
Dream scenario is Ayton or Bagley so we build around 2 dominant bigs but I'd be happy with Doncic or if our pick is 4/5 then Carter or JJJ. Please don't pick Trae Young
Ayton. He's a generational talent. Still stuns me how this sub is so high on doncic when most people have him at #5 or #6, he's good but he's no ayton.
Doncic.

I'd be really content just having the #1 pick in the first place though
At the moment I'm liking the idea of solidifying our front court with Prince/Collins/Ayton. I'm a total believer in Collins and then it's up to Ayton to be the truth. Prince fluctuates from out-of-the-league bum to All-Star right now, but if he can fall somewhere in the middle as a consistently effective starter then that's fine. Anything more is a bonus.

From there we have our other picks this year and next year to find a stud SG and some more bench help. Or we can just sign a veteran SG when the time is right. 

My opinion could changed 20 more times before the draft gets here. I was on the Doncic train before.
i want doncic the most because he's the one player in the draft i think is can't miss. i'd be happy with ayton or porter too.
if you put tillian killie on the list we would love to participate.
I don't know, a single-digit loss on the road to the top team in the conference seems fairly competitive to me.
No.. Too redundant with John Collins and there will be others available that are just as good of prospects
Fine I will play...
I wouldn't trade Dennis unless we miraculously find a way to get a top 6-8 pick with Young or Sexton still on the board. The Bucks trade offer for Dennis is a good indicator of his worth around the league - and it aint much. It's better to keep him, let him continue to develop and see how he plays out. If 2 years down the line he's not where this organization needs him to be then thats when you cut him loose.
I’m not sure about that. Looks like most people would be happy about a rental wing or point guard with a first round pick attached to it. And first I’m also being realistic that we will not get a top 10 pick for him. 
Lol you must not know much about basketball.
Tear that Nique statue down and put Tyler The Great there. It's time.
amazing holy shit
New career high for TP! Glad to see him back on track... also great to see him get the Rising Stars nod. 
Genesis 3:14

The Lord God said to the snek, "Because you have done this, cursed are you more than all cattle, and more than every beast of the field; On your belly you will go, and dust you will eat all the days of your life!" 
Good news is Dennis can't get too pissed about this because bud isn't the GM anymore

Bad news is bud probably wouldn't be happy getting rid of him after all the work he put into him already
Dennis has to be traded, his career stage doesn't fit with where we are 
I got a horford, carrol, joe Johnson, teague and Korver. I think I shouldn't buy more
Dennis is still super young, so IDK if I agree with that.   If we feel like Dennis in 3 years is the player we need running the point for us, then we should keep him.
they better be sending us Korkmaz or a pick
Now this is interesting
I doubt he'd want to leave San Antonio, but having a dude like Rudy who can just eat possessions on a young, rebuilding team is actually kinda nice.
Sup hawks bros hope y’all all have a great Friday and relaxing weekend 
Just saw Phantom and I thought it was really great, PTA and Daniel Day Lewis are a golden combo and I really hope he doesn't go through with his retirement. It's much more toned-down than his previous films I think but it really works. And Jonny's soundtrack is great as always.
Jesus says what you're doing is right, Baptize Me
I don’t understand this obsession with being undefeated.  We are 36-15 and we should be proud of that!

We are still in 1st place but Orlando, Sacramento, and Dallas are hot on our heels at 35-15, 34-16, and 36-16 respectively.

I wish this sub would stop playing games and take this race seriously!
The joke was funny before r/nba started spamming it. We’re dank, they’re normies.
I miss kryptonite after wins tbh
I think even the greatest of memes get stale after a quarter of the season, I can't believe they're still using it at All Star Break
I've only purchased a Falcons jersey from a similar store over there. Very very satisfied with it. I just picked up the Collins one so I can let you know how it is when it arrives. 
I don't see us getting rid of him really. Unless, like this says, we get an offer we can't refuse. Kent was right when he was talking about his locker room presence, especially for where we are right now. You add in his resurgence this year and it would take a pretty penny to get him off our hands
BUT: what about huge Doncic to JC lob over shoulders
ew south gwinnett dhs is better
Sure
He was really really really good at basketball
Cool! Thanks for the AMA! 
mods have better stuff to do than watch hawks games
Member actually being able to draft a top prospect? 
I JUST SAW A MAN FLY
Awesome. Love those unis too.
Those uniforms are sexy and we should just switch to them full time

Agreed -- unfortunately at this point it seems like people are starting to catch on that JJJ is the real deal, so trading up for him might be a stretch. For now, my ideal scenario for draft night is basically:

* Draft Doncic at #1
* Trade Schroder and one of our low picks to move up into the #8-10 range and draft Wendell Carter (assuming JJJ is already off the board)
* Snag Reaves with one of our other low picks

That would give us a starting lineup of Reaves-Doncic-Prince-Collins-Carter, which I *really* like a lot in terms of chemistry and fit. Reaves could guard opposing PGs on defense (which would be great because it would give him the most opportunities for steals), while Doncic could run the point on offense. Pick-and-rolls with Doncic (#1-rated pick-and-roll ball-handler) and Collins (#1-rated pick-and-roll finisher when he came into the league) would form the backbone of the offense, and Reaves, Prince, and Carter would be the perfect complements to this since they are all capable three-point shooters and play outstanding defense. Not only that, but Doncic, Carter, and Reaves are all excellent in terms of passing and basketball IQ -- and all five of the guys in that lineup would be off the charts in terms of sheer motor and competitiveness and work ethic. That would be a unit with a ton of potential to keep improving each year until they're an unstoppable well-oiled machine like the Spurs. It'd also set us up perfectly to draft the best player available in 2019 without having to worry about positional need, since we'd be able to find a spot in the rotation for whoever we selected.

Assuming we kept at least one of our other low picks, we could also draft Killian Tillie, so that would be nice as well.
Especially interesting considering that the Nuggets have been one of the better-drafting teams in recent years
Some thoughts: I think Schroder could be made to play better defense in a different system; he's a workhorse on offense but doesn't always play with the same commitment on defense. On a team with stronger floor spacing, Schroder would be even better offensively, with better outlets for drive-and-kick plays and less traffic in the paint.

The risk of Dewayne Dedmon opting in seems pretty minor for a team picking him up. There's no reason to think he'll decline a ton next season, and an expiring 6.5 million contract is not terribly burdensome for most teams. 

I agree with the article's assessment of Ilyasova; he's on an expiring contract and the market was not enthusiastic about him the last time he was in free agency, which was last offseason. But the quality of his play has been very high, and he's one of the best at drawing charges in the league, which could be relevant to a team like the Raptors or Rockets who already draw lots of fouls.
Damn is Jared Cunningham really still on the roster? Haven’t been paying attention past couple seasons. Amazing that he’s come this far and apparently is our most valuable asset.
Collins better make sportscenter tonight 
Good guy Dwight, trying to transfer some shoulder juice to DS17 
Why would they rather have plumdog for more money? This trade would be us eating Moore not asik
-18 wins. I'll take it
No but, I could see Asik + Top 10 protected first rounder for Dedmon though.
Why would we do ersan and belinelli for asik lol
Asik is healthy and has played like 15 games this season so we can't medically retire him lol
I didn't like ~~D8~~ D12 when he was on the Magic, nor the Lakers, nor the Rockets, and I was very indifferent while he was on the Hawks, even though I really wanted to be in on the hometown kid.

So yea I am gonna boo him tonight. I hope he doesn't "Kill" us. 
He has been injured and his shootings and development have been slowed but when he does play he has shown good defense and iq. He basically need to learn to shoot and get healthy.
Awesome player, horrible for the modern NBA. I think he profiles like a young Tyreke Evans: bad shot, good playmaker and slasher with good BBIQ. He's not as talented as Tyreke but he will develop given time.
Awesome player I love bembry , he needs to shape up his pick and roll game and he could have a lot of minutes 
Some have lost faith but I still have hope. It’s so good to watch someone so young with a high IQ. Fingers crossed he recovers. It would have been great to see him have the opportunity to develop more this year while he has playing time. 
How does Rudy Gay fit into this though?
Whatever it takes to bring this to the light. 
I think the general book has been written, but there's some additional nuance in the things he does/doesn't do well.

I still really like him, and I'm torn between him and Nique's Bahamian love child. Despite his weaknesses he is still ****dominating**** EuroLeague at a super young age - and there *have* been productive wings who are slow - Bird, BRoy, Pierce, Peja, our very own Iso Joe.

I think as a secondary ball handler he would be just fine. If we could draft him Top 3 and then consolidate our two late 1sts for a 6-8 pick and snag Mo Bamba or Jaren Jackson I'd be very happy.
Could Killian Tillie microwave a burrito so hot that even Killian Tillie couldn’t eat it?
Good bot
good enough for me
It was funny so I swindled it so now it's mine
Same. Welcome to our reddit and the Atlanta Hawks family!
for real though Dennis deserves it over Ben Simmons and Kemba Walker.

His efficiency isn't great, at 51 TS%, but he's putting up 19.6/3/6.5, which is pretty close to Wall anyway.
"Is that an oversized contract in your pants or are you just happy to see me?"
I'm glad someone else noticed
:)
ay why the fuk is this stickied 

good shit tho
Love the video recaps man
Keep up the good work and you will be a better mod than the rest.
I think these standings are pretty accurate. ALL WEST IS BELOW ATL!
With our luck, I am almost 100% sure we won't get the top 3 picks...
looking at breaking Wilt's record any time now, not bad at all
Our invasion was successful 
God damn I love this place.
Most days I prefer retooling.  But against former Hawks I prefer remaining competitive.
fun fact: we are 9-11 against the west. 
To be honest I enjoy winning
Wish they would’ve put Teague on the line in the 4th so I could have gotten some free Chick-Fil-A
It's a win win
While still getting a top 3 draft pick
Its a win lose win
he gotta funny name 
JEFF TEAGUE TOP 10 ANIME BETRAYALS
I have T Wolves friends so this one would actually be kinda nice to win.
You guys are trying to get a high pick right? We'd gladly give you Teague back. You don't even have to trade us anything in return
lol thx Teague hahaha
LOL Teague 

what a great return to Atlanta 
Feeling pretty fucking good
give us wiggins and ok
We got Teague assigned to you guys to help (y)our pick for this year get better.
It's kinda like having even more dads
Thanks Miles :) 
Killian Tillie > Rudy Gay
Haha jokes on you! I wanted to draft Kevin Knox anyways! #DrinkClorox4KevinKnox
agreed.  it's time to rebuild from scratch, with aging superstar/allstar-caliber players as our foundation.

Terry

Ginobili

Carter

Nowitzki

Gasol

that's a great roster to build upon fellas. oh and you cant forget Hawk legend Elton Brand. It's time to bring the big man back to ATL

Good write-up man, I'd have to agree with most of what you said. Honestly out of everyone I would take doncic, mainly because I feel he fits our playstyle the best
It is confirmed. As a person who has watched countless Gonzaga games this season, I can wholeheartedly say that Killian Tillie will become the next NBA legend. I urge all Hawks fans to start using the phrase "**Tillie Tillie**" to express their joy and excitement for the next GOAT.
Lol what are we, the Hornets?
Actually Kllian Tillie fits our system best.
Please focus all your posting time on (positively) discussing Killian and why he will lead the Hawks to a championship. 
Bud a good coach? What a surprise
Love me some bud 
Hah. Scheme is really interesting to do work with, because people assume it'll be directly tied with efficiency. Personnel and execution are also big components that are part of the equation. But each of those teams definitely have some of the best schemes, really optimizing the talent they have pretty well.
Makes sense, we are pretty good at BLOBs and SLOBs
I have to pay to read articles on AJC.com? lol 
Where did the undefeated Hawks meme go? I enjoyed that.
Good thing we're getting Doncic instead.
Thanks for visiting our subreddit! We know the Wizards sub is dead, so you’re welcome to post here anytime!
Lmao y’all were never amount to anything. 
Good point, this isn't the first time we've been obliterated because of our transition D this year either
Yeah it's true lol. Although neither will the hawks probably. Just the unfortunately state of the league right now. 
Tillian Killie yourself lol
compelling argument for him, I'm sold 
draft him with our highest pick just to be safe
Not really. Coaches know how much more important Horford is to a team than Drummond. They don’t just look at counting stats. 
1. [Deandre Ayton](http://swarthmorephoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/deandre.jpg) is a [FREAK!](https://hawksquawk.net/community/uploads/monthly_2018_01/201BF6A2-B39E-40E7-800D-6374DE4C96BC.jpeg.62be14d506f48d43c83e2a7d3d7c7b11.jpeg) 

2. Marvin Bagley is the guy I think will end up being the pick. Four personal visits to Duke from the GM? Multiple owners going to see him in person? Sounds like he’s the guy. Which is fine with me. I’ve really talked myself into him since those reports came out.

3. Luka Doncic is a really nice piece for any team. Unlike the first two, I don’t think he’s got a clear path to being a top ten player in the league. 

4. Michael Porter Jr has primary scorer on a contender ability. If not for the injury, I’d have him higher. He’s got the kind of flashy ability that can attract others to play here.

5. Trae Young is incredible. If we didn’t have Dennis, he’d be my three or maybe even two. He’s just doing things I’ve never seen a college player do, and he’s a teenager. He’s got the it factor.

6.  Tanking wasn’t worth it this year. I like Jaren Jackson Jr, and believe he’s going to be a very good modern big, but Bamba is a pretty sure thing on a he defensive end so it’s close. I’d be disappointed either way 
Ideally i'd love to see Doncic & Troy Brown or Hamidou Diallo in a Hawk uniform next season
Bagley has a much much harder path to becoming a top ten player in the league than Luka.
You’re right we should definitely go with the best player available, especially since we are in total rebuild mode. Also, I feel the same way about Trae Young. Don’t think we should draft him but I’d definitely be happy with any of the other players listed in the top 5 currently. We gotta keep watching them as the College season progresses though.
no that'd actually be a great trade for ATL. Problem is, Dennis ain't worth a top 6-8 pick. However, if a team were willing to take him + extra like maybe our latter picks, i'd pull the trigger IF Young, Porter Jr, or Sexton are still on the board.
See I just don’t see a way Luka will be top 10. Top 20 maybe, but not top 10. Bagley could put up Anthony Davis numbers potentially. I think Ayton has a ceiling outcome of being top 10 all time though.
Doncic is a primary creator and could potentially average 20+/7/10 imo. That's obviously high end ceiling outcome but I think he's that good of a passer. He's a better passer than Harden was at his age.


Bagley will never be the defensive player that Davis is due to his length and lack of instincts. Davis is also a better natural shooter.
LOL mahinmi just tryna make enemies out of the whole team now
OKAY JERSEYS ARE KINDA THAT FIRE FLAME
I’m on some new meds that I’m not used to yet and I just spent a good minute trying to figure out why Washington was a moving company specializing in transporting televisions and computer monitors.
Nice to see TP and D Money active tonight
John Collins shooting threes is a beautiful thing 
Man, I get we're trying to suck, but I think we have a lot of the right guys... losing gets you better players who come and go, but you can't remove a winning culture
his form looked REALLY good. he's easily the most slept on rookie for me, especially if he starts knocking down threes with regularity. & if y'all get Ayton that's going to be one of the most athletic frontcourts in the universe

I'm still perplexed how he fell to 19 'cause it's not like he was some great unknown. he had plenty of buzz going into the draft, crazy athleticism, produced at a major program, and age wasn't an issue. the lottery was filled with good prospects but I'm rly not sure what the teams from 15-18 were thinking.
    ya but we need a winning 
              C U L T U R E   I I
I think this is part of the reason we've kept baze and moose around for so long imo, they keep that winning culture that weve cultivated. Alot of the time when we lose games it's not from lack of effort or anything like that, it's because the other team genuinely has more talent than we do. And if there's one thing that we know in the NBA, it's the team with the talent win the games
Yeah the first time I saw him shoot, just like a normal midrange jimbo, I was so impressed by how nice and fluid his form is. You don't see that from guys his size all that often, but with his shooting mechanics looking so good it doesn't surprise me if he turns out to be a solid perimeter shooter.
Winning Culture 2: The Retooling
Shout out to Coach Bud also. I know it was commonplace not long ago to criticize Bud, but that guy is coaching his ass off right now and really proving, despite the record, that he's top of the class in the East along with Spoelstra and Stevens.

I'm fully confident about our team returning to contention sooner rather than later because I can't see a loser's mentality ever settling in with him at the helm.
Looks impressive until you realize he didn't jump up there, he's just hanging onto the rim by his teeth
It's so awesome to watch him grab rebounds when his elbow is literally 11 get off the ground
Chances are we won't get the top pick, but anywhere in the top 4 and I'm happy!
haha nice
If he ever leaves my life is officially over. We will never have a better PA announcer ever. 
Idk what I want more: to stay true to the tank or to run a win in Dwight’s face for wanting to kill us
That guy Ilyasova knows how to ball man... I feel a good trade vibe here!
 Love that he’s been jacking a couple last two games
I’m just glad he’s gone so I can go back to hating his bitch ass
Slowly but surely bud will allow him to let it fly 
I still love Dwight.
I hope so. He seems to have a good stroke. 
> Love that he’s been jacking


> He seems to have a good stroke


( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
😂😂😂 nice
Shea loves throwing shots at dwight and hes a spurs fan lol. I wish dwight got more respect, he is a first ballot hall of famer.
Eh I like Dwight but it's still funny
It was funny, I just dont like Shea lol
Not that impressive. We've been undefeated so far this entire season.
This gives me feely feels, the kind of feels that feel...feely
Lol the shade
Yeah, it sucks. With throwbacks it would’ve been dope since we both have the best in the league for throwbacks 
You can't retool without remaining competitive so resigning Plumlee to a 5 year deal and trading for Rudy Gay seem like no-brainers.
Came for Rudy Gay meme
Perhaps the Hawks of Atlanta should trade for Rudy, specifically the Gay one
> Came

Well he is attractive, no judgment here
fair enough but Allen seems like a Robert Covington type player to me and if he is good enough to start let him but he would be a huge upgrade at either the backup 1/2 positions. 
Was going with the mock that was preset

i honestly don't know anything about anyone not in the top 6
This is a yuge foundational piece for Your Atlanta Hawks - plus the new Emory practice facility & the reno of Philips. These are the rebuilding pieces away from the court that will alter the culture of the franchise for the better. Haven't had owners willing to spend like this. Ever.  
Excited to see Dwight again
I don't blame Horford for leaving. We weren't going to give him the contract the Celtics offered. 4 yr/$113M? No way. He was my favorite Hawk for a long time. Still love him, he did what he needed to do. We should have started rebuilding after he left. 
I tought we offered more though? And either way we were never going to win a championship with a guy to scared to get rebounds... If we had any other guy in our 60 win season im sure we couldve won it all.
I’m glad we didn’t. We don’t have the young pieces/ draft picks the Celtics have to build around him, so we’d have to spend too much money to acquire free agents. We would be really shitty if he were still here. And he’s not the kind of guy that people will take a discount to play with. 
Here's something I wonder: Bud likes to have rookies earn their minutes, which is fine, but what does that look like? For a guy like John Collins, who has in my estimation been one of the hardest-working, most effective players on this team, what more does he need to do? 

Collins and Dedmon are averaging more minutes per game than Plumlee already, so why is Plumlee starting? Plumlee is 6-11 and 250 lbs. Collins is 6-10  and 235. Size alone doesn't seem to be the difference here, and if it were, Dedmon starting with Collins and Plumlee off the bench seem more effective than Plumlee right off the bat. I would be interested to hear more from Budenholzer about his plans for the rotation and how he sees Plumlee as a chess piece. 
Collins still struggles with big, strong centers. I think that's the main reason he doesn't start yet, but I agree he works hard and is unselfish. Honestly I'd love to see him have more usage and create his own shot more, which I know he can do. But he's mostly been setting screens and passing the ball right back. He neve really looks to score unless it's for a jam or a putback
Yaknow, it's kinda funny that now he's starting to install him more in the offense because it was around this time last year that he was implimenting prince more too
Remember those back-to-back games he made buzzer beating 3's from like half court to win them?

100% agree but your first mistake was going on /r/nba
I’ve got a better plan. 
1) Draft Ayton (or Bagley of the front office really is in love with him)
2) Trade up with the other picks this year including whatever we get before the trade deadline to go up and get Mikal Bridges to play SG
3) suck again
4) draft Barrett or Reddish
5) stop the tank and have a promising squad of young talent
6) Find a way to get a star who wants to be a part of what we are building (like what the wolves did) and get Giannis or Kawhi
7) dynasty
8) Coach Bud is elected president 
9) America becomes a consistent 15 ppg scorer and is given a large contract by another nation that it never quite lives up to
I would be very okay with sending the Cavs Dedmon/Baze/Minnys 1st in return for Brooklyns pick and a possible Cavs future 1st. The price is steep but Dedmon offers the ability to start at the 5 and brings great defense and slides Love back to the 4. Baze can play the 2/3 and will play good defense and can hit his shots now, more importantly his high energy on defense can make up for IT's lack of defense. 

Honestly think the best Cavs lineup would be Dedmon/Love/LBJ/Baze/IT and with the depth they have on the bench with Wade/Korver/Green/Crowder/Frye they should be good. Making it to the Finals would be a given but how would they match up against the warriors? 
For most of them yeah, I don’t remember a time where he didn’t 
Pop would literally break up his 25 year friendship with Bud if the Hawks had the gall to offer that package for Kawhi lol.

If anything it'd be Baze (for salary matching) + Prince + Dedmon + Wolves pick + our 2019 pick (top 3 protected) + maybe some Dorsey or some seconds even?  and they'd probably add Mills (he hasn't been great right) or Pau to get rid of bad contracts. And I still don't think in a hundred years they'd take that. 
Lol did anyone check the free agent scenario at the end?
I honestly don’t think our pick this year + Dennis + prince would even be enough
DID SOMEONE SAY RUDY GAY
Good shit tonight boys, we needed this. Orlando and Sacramento have been catching up. 
Tonight's a good night to retool while remaining competitive
cheeky reminder that Bud and Casey nearly got in a fight last time we played so i kinda wanna win this one for bud
this is not my beautiful house, this is not my beautiful wife
Hahahaha that's great
They better be going to games for all the top prospects.
[okay i guess Schlenk does have a preference lol](https://twitter.com/CVivlamoreAJC/status/956169722776694784)
The Hawks owners just really love Duke basketball -- they go to coach k's fantasy camp every year. 
Bagley and JC are pretty similar players imo. I think Bagley has a bit higher ceiling though. It’s why I’m hesitant to want him in the top 4. Both are guys that win because they hustle and are super athletic. I think both of them will always put up good numbers because of that, but it becomes redundant if both are on the court at the same time. 
Or 
D) he thinks Bagley is the best player and is willing to find a way to make it work even if he isn’t the perfect fit.

I think Ayton is the top prospect and a better fit because of ceiling, by Bagley’s ceiling really isn’t too far off. I could see him becoming one of the premiere bigs in the league for sure. I’d say, of all the prospects in this draft, he’s the best bet to be an all star. He’s 20 and 10 personified
Also a very good point. It may infact be that he really does think he would be the player with one of the highest upside in the draft. It's hard not to imagine how well bag could develop at hawks University. Especially considering how young he is.

That fit issue could play a role in trying to position ourselves for the 2019 draft as well.

Either way, this is a very interesting turn of events

What’s up with this article? The whole story about Aldridge is that he and Pop repaired their relationship, so they’re not going to trade him. Also, why would we want a player as good as him right now?
The spurs are better than us but I agree that we should get a player like that
I know. It’s funny still. I don’t think he would take us to a good enough level to make our tanking worse. I think he will make us better if we have the right pieces around him
Looks like a delicious vomit.
Dennis, Plumlee, Collins, Dorsey... So proud of you :')
I have never been more proud
What trade package do the Cavs realistically have to offer? I just really can’t see bazemore being moved to the Cavs right now

If I’m Schlenk And they call, I pick up and say “We know what’s going on in Cleveland, Korver told us everything. Give us Kevin Love and the Brooklyn pick for Bazemore or no deal.” Followed by an abrupt end to the call 
I know Baze isn't the best player and all that and it might be best to trade him for assets. But man it would hurt to lose a guy like Baze. A guy who really does love the team. A guy who took a cheaper contract to stay here when other teams were throwing money at him. not to mention I think it looks bad to other potential free agents when a guy takes a home town discount and then you trade him when things don't go your way.
THAT'S WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT!!!!!! WELCOME ABOARD THE "KEEP BAZE AT ANY COST" TRAIN!
I feel like Schlenk would dump the salary for anything. I can totally see him dowgrading from baze to Tristan or even Shumpert. It means we would win less and therefore have a higher pick and get another pick (might not even be a first lol).

Although Tristan wouldnt exactly be a salary dump since his contract is huge too, you get the pick for free and still lose. Shumpert + random deep bench dudes would actually save us cap space.
I would take the Brooklyn pick love would leave 
thats not how it works lol. he's not just gonna give back 6 million
He seems more in control.  Plays his role much betterand isnt trying to do extra. 


While his play isn't worth his contract, he as a person is worth every penny and then some. 
Kawhi gas one foot out the door anyways so sure
I think Schlenk would take it if we got the Cavs own first round pick.
we already own the Cavs pick for 2019 but it's top 15 protected, they could remove the protections as a trade asset, and if LeBron ends up leaving that could easily be a lottery pick.
For sure lol, the should have picked a different player. He's the last guy I'd expect this from
^our ^flaws ^make ^us ^unique 
[I just talk about the hawks a lot in general (and some healthly leftism)](https://i.imgur.com/jSTS9I5.png)

[also im a nice boy](https://i.imgur.com/ddgpxVS.png)
For real though we need to cool it, the Kings and/or Magic are going to swindle us if we're not careful
To be honest, top 4 is what is really important. Its doncic, ayton, porter, bagley, and then the rest. I personally would love porter if we do fall to something like 4
shump, frye, & their own 2018 pick for Baze seems fair. just gotta threaten shump to opt out next year because I doubt he will. dude is straight garbage and has no value around this league
This is awesome for all tbh. Cavs would get a great defender, baze would get a more competitive team, we'd get picks and that contract off and we'd also lose our 2nd/3rd best player to help us tank harder 
IF YOU ARE KENT BAZEMORE PLEASE DO NOT READ THIS!

ok now that he’s gone, I would love to get a first round pick for him. I love him, but getting a first and maybe removing the protections on their pick next year would be perfect. We would have 4 this year and could possibly package 3 to move up pretty far. 
I'll always love Baze for his energy and passion, but will be very happy for him to go out and compete and add to the Cavs. 
All their success makes sense now
lmao
This comic is hilarious 
[Schlenk during the trade deadline calling around to get more picks ](https://i.redd.it/zpfwendh7qa01.jpg) 
I feel like I need to see more of MPJ in action (assuming he actually comes back and plays some college ball) before I really go all-in on him; his handle looks worryingly loose at the moment and it's hard to imagine him being able to create for himself very easily at the NBA level until he tightens it up and develops more of a floor game. That being said, I've still got him in my top 3 for now. I know Bagley's more of a 4 and MPJ's more of a 3, but when you consider that they're actually about the same size it seems like there's not much Bagley would be able to do that MPJ wouldn't be able to do better (especially in the shooting department).
Easily Bagley. Ayton has more size but if Bagley is available at 3 it would be as good of a pick as Doncic or Ayton at 1
Bagley quite easily. You have to get the BPA and Bagley is that guy. Idk why people are quick to say that Collins and Bagley can't work together. They're both under 21 years of age, I have no doubt in my mind that them attending consecutive years of Bud university will make them a good tandem in the long run. 
Couldn’t have said it better coach
The injury is really one that athletes play through all the time. He had a microdissectomy surgery which is more often than not for herniated discs. Peyton Manning won his MVP with herniated discs, Dwight has herniated discs and hasn't missed a season in his life, Tony Romo made the cowboys relevant again with herniated discs. From what I've researched, 90% of the time athletes come back just as strong as they were before they got the surgery 

It's obviously not the most ideal situation, but if he's really feeling as good as he implied when he said "whoever said it would take more than 2-3 weeks was lying" then I don't think we should have a problem.

If we're #3 and he's there, I won't be complaining at all. Especially now that we have one of the best sports medicine practices in the nation literally right next door to our practice facility

Franchise player? Sure. Centerpiece? I’m not so sure. Maybe Trae but he’s giving me doubt lately. Doncic looks like a sure bet to be a good number two or three for a contending team though. I’m a big fan of his even though my post didn’t make it seem that way. There’s value in safety, but not so much in our situation I think.
[Good article on the subject](https://fansided.com/2017/11/22/back-surgery-michael-porter-nba-draft-prospects/)
WOW, this was a QUALITY read. Incredibly informative, thanks a million for the link! That probably deserves a separate post in and of itself honestly.

From the research I've done personally on the issue, there are ALOT of factors and disagreeing information on the topic. I've read some research papers on it that says age and gender (sex) have alot to do with if reherniation happens, but also some that disagree with that sentiment completely, and some just have age and some just have gender. The percentages for reoccurrence also vary extremely. The medicals will be incredibly important to his draft stock to see about his specific situation.

Another twist that is interesting to think about, if we do get him and give him a pseudo redshirt next year (the Embiid "no back to backs" treatment), that would give us a real shot at the 2019 draft as well.

The whole situation is very interesting, I didn't even think about what Sam tweeted.


I see a worse harden who is a centerpiece, but I don’t think he has the athleticism to be as good as Harden is, so that demotes him to a #2. The hawks haven’t drafted a #2 in my life unless you wanna call Horford that. He would be a great get. 
Luka's taller, a better defender and passer than Harden was at his age.
Projected top 4 next year are really good too
Yeah at his age, but there’s a ceiling on how good of a scorer he’s going to be unless he’s an out of this world shooter. Like to me, I’d be happiest with him besides Ayton. Ayton has that top 20 player ever ceiling you don’t get a chance to have ever. It doesn’t matter anyway. I’m ordering whoever is the pick’s jersey on draft night 
Hello, my brand 'Washington Wizards' would like to purchase an ad for exactly 0.42 garlicoins. I'll have my people contact your people
 John Collins comes in, tries to get in good positions to score, gets ignored by teammates, gets subbed out.

This frustrates me
For the love of God please keep the lights dimmed on our seats for the games. It's embarrassing to see so many empty seats
“Blocked by Collins” is such a beautiful phrase.

Sure! I’ll let security know so they keep you out. 
Yeah it’s higher up in the 100’s but it’s still great view and got end of row seats. 
That’s really dope, wish I had found out earlier and found someone to go with. Enjoy 👏🏻
Any of Ayton or Doncic and I'll be a happy camper
https://youtu.be/sZyAI5D-qq4 one more proof he's extremely good! All dunks!!
Or he wants his extremely high iq euro player who fits his sytem perfectly. Also he has JC to be Duncan.
Ill make a reddit gold bet with you right now that we take Ayton (if available).  You win if we take Luca (if available).

You down?
I just want you guys to see a bigger  picture of him. That's all. No need to stress it out. Peace and all good.
Am I the only one who kind of likes what we got right now? Especially the City jerseys those are sick. But the throwbacks are good too. 

Idk I would love a more modern Nique jersey but I’m also ok with what we have
actually they're extremely good jerseys and volt green is beautiful.
I also dig our unis, better than alot of others out there 
Hell I loved the red white and blue unis, generic sure, but it was a really fun era 
I'm with you. I think the city jerseys are one of the best ones we have now. 
They are definitely better than the navy blue ones. Which is why I liked them at first, but now I think they will probably end up representing the rebuilding period before we switch to something that hopefully sticks.
This one really sucked but honestly I was kinda afraid we would go a win streak so I'm glad really
and that Caw! Caw! after upvoting is a nice touch!
I see him playing for another team. It’s a shame, but no way he stays here after this year. Might as well get what we can for him now. He would’ve been such a great guy to have when this team was the one seed. 
He fits the team, but he doesn't fit the timeline.
Couldn’t agree more. 
That feel when the top tier prospect we're gonna get this year is gonna probably stop us from getting based leaf dad ):
Can we draft two top 3 picks in a row? Or does that start next year?
I mean the new draft rule that you can't draft two top 3 picks in consecutive years (Barrett and Ayton are both top 3 draft picks).
This is a very good point 
Now that's a hot dad
anything without ~~puke~~ volt is good
Away jerseys... welcome to mcdonalds my name is dennis
I like the look in the away and alt colors but I don't love the way that it looks in the home whites.

Dem is sexy
If you Google "vector nba jersey template" or something you should get some results. You could probably find psds as well if Photoshop is more your thing.
It's really unfortunate that John Collins hasn't gotten more attention nationally because he deserves it. He's a rookie on a not-so-good team who has risen to the challenge and then some. He's efficient, especially for a rookie, and good on defense. 

I have the feeling that in 2-3 years when he hits his prime and has a good supporting cast, nba fans will think "this guy came out of nowhere!" when Hawks fans will know John the Baptist has been a long time coming.
We are hot from 3 tonight! 🔥

Let's be real Trae Young doesn't look good in anything with that hairline
Until Plumlee and Baze (sorry Baze you know I love you) get those mega deals off the salary cap. It’s gonna be at least 2020 unless we can get rid of them. And that’s the best case scenario because it assumes we hit on two early lottery talents and become an attractive free agent destinations to actually spend that money well. 

In 2021, the crown jewel free agent will be available and 26 years old.  The Greek Freak. The one that got away! Heir apparent to King James. In the perfect world, we hit home runs on the next couple picks and get, let’s say, 2 NBA stars along with solid role players on rookie deals. Then we might actually be a destination for the top guys. The super max makes that tough though, so maybe we collect picks as we are now and find tank until 2020 when the big contracts are off the books and make a mega trade for Giannis if the Bucks continue to waste their time with him. 

Giannis is just the ideal example, but what I’m trying to say is, we are going to have to draft at least 2 more franchise players to superstars to be able to sign the players to become contenders. 
Draft a superstar this year and then go full Spurs next year and win a championship
One thing I've emphasized before (and still believe strongly) is that  we cannot and should not just tank for one year and then declare mission accomplished and start trying to add quality veterans and win games again. In my view, the right way to do it is to keep tanking until your young star draftees are so good that they're winning too many games all by themselves (despite being the only non-scrubs on the team) for you to tank anymore even if you wanted to. That's when you know you're ready to stop tanking and start adding role players -- when you have no ability to do otherwise.

For the Hawks, the plan IMO is that we tank this season and the next two or three seasons, [then when all our big contracts come off the books and all our young draftees are still on their rookie contracts,](http://www.basketballinsiders.com/atlanta-hawks-team-salary/) that's when we use all our cap space to pursue a couple of max-level free agents (and fill out the rest of the roster with MLE and veteran minimum guys). Sort of similar to what the Lakers are trying to do, except that we'll have drafted transcendentally great franchise players that free agents will actually want to come play with.
You think Bud will tank for a minimum of 3 Years? I don’t see any scenario where bud is willing to do that. He’s just too good a coach. I think 2 Years tops depending on the draft picks.  
Bud has the blueprints, I really don't think it's out of the realm of possibility we get back in the playoff race after this year.

I also don't think bud is down to try to retool another year lol
Ooh that's a nice fuckin birdie right there!
This bird picture is much appreciated. Thank you and keep up the good work.
Falcons are actually more closely related to parrots.
Lol @ the twitter comments. I'm telling ya, some folks don't surf. 
That Dennis' spot is entirely predictable lol. 
My thoughts are that John Collins is really good
Baze gets underrated on defense, people only see him dribbling the ball off his feet 15 times a game and focus on that. Don't forget what he was so effective at during the 60 win season: coming off the bench to play solid defense and blend in offensively. If his contract were appropriately in proportion to that role, and if he wasn't being forced to carry an offensive load that he clearly isn't capable of, he would be an awesome player to have on our roster.
Because
1. Our current GM didn’t draft him and he might not be a part of his vision
2. I don’t think he will ever give him the usage percentage that he has now. He’s about at the same level as Lebron and Giannis. He’s 55th in the league in PER. This could very well be his best season scoring wise and it could be the right time to sell. 
> he’s averaging second most drives per game in the league 

First off, attempting to do something a lot isn't necessarily a good thing and although I agree he has a good mindset just him having the ambitions to become a top 5 PG doesn't mean he ever will most likely.

Alright so, I don't want to trade him but I wouldn't be completely against it either. This season is probably the one where we can get the biggest return on him and the idea for trading him is getting another lottery pick in what seems to be a stacked (but top-heavy) draft.

 Dennis is a great player but his defense is awful and has shown this season that although he can definitely be a starter in the league he'll never be *the guy* on a contender, which means we need another player to be *the guy*. Now, we have our own pick to draft that player with but if we can flip Dennis for another top 10 pick that would greatly improve our chances of drafting a franchise player. 
Nobody on this roster is untouchable, but I'm of the opinion that we won't get fair return for Dennis in a trade considering most good teams are solid at PG and any bad team won't trade a lottery pick for him. I'm fine keeping Schroder and trying to add a SG who can at least shoot better and make plays more consistently been Bazemore. 

While Chicago would likely match I'd max LaVine (or whatever Chicago won't match) to get him on the Hawks.
Teague was worth a lottery pick last year, Dennis is arguably as good or better than Teague and we could attach the Wolves, Rockets or Cavs picks as well.
>We need a big man in this draft (Ayton preferably)

Uh if Ayton is seen as the best player in the draft sure but we have Collins who is already mostly a C and can even get a little bigger in the coming years. 
The Cavs ? Their primary ball handler is Lerbon, then they have IT, Drose and Calderon and then you think they would want another PG

We’re about to trade Dedmon and Ersan, if we draft Trae young we won’t have any bigs either. We really need to draft Ayton the guy reminds me of Shaq in terms of size and he’s a way better shooter. Let’s keep in mind Ayton shoots the greatest better than Doncic. We know Schroeder won’t be the face of the franchise but he is not bad to have as our 3rd option especially for scoring and kicking out on drives.
I'm ok with Ayton, but 

> Let’s keep in mind Ayton shoots the greatest better than Doncic.


what does this even mean?
I'm not saying don't draft Ayton but we need the Best Player Available not necessarily a center so that argument just doesn't work. If Schlenk/Bud believe the BPA is Ayton than I'm all for it and we should go for that but imo I still see Doncic as the best player in the draft and Bagley and Porter are still in that conversation as well
I read he ranks 95/96 out of all eligible point guards in defensive win shares
Oh I think Ayton is pretty clearly the number one guy. I get this feeling in my gut that it’s going to be Porter though. He just has that look of a star. Maybe it’s the hair. Maybe it’s that we are both vegan so he gets love from me. 
I have this weird feeling (based on absolutely nothing) that Ayton will be like the best player from this draft in terms of stats/numbers but that another guy will be a lot more impactful for their team and therefore better to build around.
He is just trying to do us good and increase his trade value... 
Be sure to check ya out at ATLSportsHQ.com and @ATLSportsHQ on twitter as well as our dedicated Hawks twitter account @ATLHawks_Talk
Thanks man appreciate that!!
Beating good teams during a tank is like losing to bad teams during a run.

These are games you can't afford to win. I'm shook.
If we have to win I'd rather us beat good teams than beat bad teams
Doncic and Ayton are in their own tier for me. Don't know which one I'd take, but they're my top 2 undisputedly. Here's to hoping we get the top two picks!
We are really playing decent ball, that's probably why you've seen so many reports of our players on the block because we need to stay in the race 

But the more I look at the top of the draft, the more Id honestly just be happy to be in the top 4-5 at all. 

Porter's injury is more than likely herniated discs and apparently 90% of the time athletes come back from that as good as they were before. Shit, Peyton Manning had herniated discs the season he won MVP

Ayton impresses everytime he steps on the hardwood. Dude legitimately is the complete package. Rumors of his effort we're greatly exaggerated.

Doncic is self explanatory. The film speaks for itself. I do hope he picks up his 3% soon though, lately his play has been alittle concerning but I would still take him in the top 3 EASILY

Im not too interested in Bagley though, we have our own Bagley in a sense already with Collins. But worse comes to worse I'd take him and let him and Collins tear up the paint


It's a good year to be in our position :D
I hope we both do too! I personally don't see the gap between bagley and ayton anymore. Now knowing bagley has another year of development until he's aytons age. At 6ft11, Bagley could grow another inch or two as well!

But yeah I'd love us both to get picks 1 and 2!
So many injuries man. The teams given up in many of the recent games it appears. We are still missing vuch, Ross and Isaac but we should be better than we are!

I'd love doncic on our team. I think he and Gordon would be an amazing 1-2 punch with Isaac as a third string, providing defence.
Man imagine Collins and bagley together at the 4/5. Bagley is the new small ball 5. He's actually quite tall, 6ft11 at 18. He has a nice handle and developing shot. Could be a fantastic fit.

I think MPJ or doncic fits your team best though! 
Yeah Doncic or Trae has to be the way the magic go if they can. They have a bunch of bigs 
We'll take any of them haha!
Can we just have a new team that gets the top 7 picks? Young, MPJ, doncic, Bagley, Ayton with sexton and bamba as reserves? Hahaha 
Yeah I think the trade deadline will determine the teams direction.
We are gonna be sellers so the returns we get will determine how the remainder of the season plays out I believe!

I'd love a top 4 pick but we will see.
Great stuff, thanks for posting
While you’re here be sure to check us out at AtlSportsHQ.com 
Thanks! 
The aquarium would be cool, how much does it cost to get in?
Ambidextrous baze is the best baze 
Nice try, this is photoshopped. Know how I know? Baze isn't #29
I am Happy when we win because we win.

I am Happy when Bazemore makes shot because it ups his trade value.

I am Sad when we win because I want my Ayton.
> trade value.

lol
That bwai Schroder with 15 assists and 0 turnovers. Realized his shot was off in the first and started setting everyone one up with nice looks in the second. Great work by Dennis.
This team is getting too good
Don't get to watch him much but man I really dislike boogie cousins

how you gonna yell at the ref on the last play there when you been getting calls all night? Glad he took that L tonight
Great W for the SKWAH. Hopefully Taurean can pull himself out of this funk.
2 wins in a row... RIP #1 pick. Hopefully we sell so much at the deadline.
Not the best time to say this but i see Dorsey has been getting good minutes lately.How have you guys seen him so far         
Fantastic, now which team wants to take Bazemore's contract
Getting his trade value up at just the right time! Nice to see him redeem himself too after that missed game-winner earlier in the season.
Turn to the Zona game and you’ll see why it’s awesome 
I've been thoroughly impressed with Dorsey recently
Cone Street has some good parking decks. It'll cost you around $10. 
Got tickets on Stubhub an hour ago and gonna make the mile trek to MARTA to catch this game. Hope we win, but I'm also excited to catch the twin towers in action. 
I love good Baze
What a win!
Really wish I went tonight also, you can basically sit wherever you want lol
Pretty sparse, but the energy is great because we all got upgraded. Now if only the Hawks could get one of their 3s to drop. 
Wow this sub is real lol. People have too much time on their hands...
Good pod.. Dennis seems like a good dude, gets a lot of shit but I like his personality
Because we are re-tooling while remaining competitive and everyone is saying we're losing because he's taking too many shots or whatever
Prince is worth the BKN pick, Bembry isn't, especially since Cavs are looking to win now if they're trading the pick.
Lol sure, but Cavs would want a young piece if the BKN pick is included.
Which is why I posted this. I think it’s interesting that it’s so close between users.
But I love Taurean. Maybe you’re right, but it’s hard to let go of a young player who is getting better for a chance of a higher ceiling 
I'd argue that Mikal is a much better defensive prospect that prince is or ever was
Yeah I've heard the phrase "best wing defender in college basketball" being thrown around re: Bridges, so I'd say you're correct
Thanks Magic!
Way to close for my liking. Why can’t the Magic and Kings suck more? I’m gonna be so mad if we suck all season and don’t get a top 3 pick. 
Get me a first rounder for him 
Tru, however we could have upped his contract a little tbh. I doubt that his market value at the time was as high as it is now. It just stings knowing that we won't get the best return for him because of that player option
> a field of Jae Crowders

Just beautiful.
I want the best available player this year before I start worrying about how they might fit with next years pick lol
Well he's already come out and said that he isn't really going to gain more weight. It's in his blood to be that skinny and "he's tried". This is according to his players tribune article he published

[It's a great read if you haven't checked it out.](https://www.theplayerstribune.com/bol-bol-oregon-ducks-basketball/amp/) I'm pulling for him 
That doesn't mean he can't become a great player, KD is a stick and still dominates. We still don't know how he'll be in CBB. I wouldn't be against getting him, but if we do we'd just have to make sure we can accommodate to his unique ability
We beat them last year. Don't remember when or where, but that was the one that broke a long streak. Maybe now we own them!! 
Could do Ersan for Hezonja + 2nd round pick, which would be good cause it make the Magic a lot better and they are way to close to us in the pingpong race. 
He'll be a free agent after the season 
No point trading for him right now, because the team that gets him with a trade can only offer him 1 year deal with the money that was his option that Orlando declined. Which means he will easily find something better if he shows some promise. If the Hawks want him they should give it a shot during summer free agency.
Can’t believe people really want Dennis gone. He will fit great into our future.
Good win for Dennis, Bud and team morale, I'll take it.
Tank is life but it’s important to play well in games where people actually show up. Gotta keep da fans happy 
WE'RE GOING TO THE SUPER BOWL OF BASKETBALL
Very high chance the magic swindle our (projected) number 1 overall pick tomorrow
Thanks Hawk bro's :)
I haven’t posted on here in a minute but Kent Bazemore goes full tilt all the dang time and I appreciate it
Awesome game from everyone.  Energy was pretty good today.  Great day for the team.
Yeah he was making all the right plays there, getting switches and taking advantage. It was like three back-to-back possessions where he got whatever he wanted. Driving layup, quick stop and midrange, and then really high off the glass to avoid the defender was beautiful. 
no way snek lets him go unless its for a top 5 pick
Shit, gotta keep coach happy too lol
Yeah I'm not concerned about it, we will be fine. Especially once they get healthy like you said
I loved the twirl Ersan did with that pass
Lullwater is a beautiful park, but in all my time there I never saw a hawk. Lucky!
Tyler Dorsey is developing nicely
Nice stealth tank attempt by the Cawks
Dennis is so good 
Welcome back to our biannual dad-dicking by the Spurs, hope everyone brought adequate lube and tissues. 
I can't wait to see how many points we'll lose by tonight. 10? 20?
The mod team is keeping our eyes on you today, don't try any funny business.
Didn't look like it at first, but maybe you are right. Refs just trying to help our ~~tank~~ competitiveness. 
Not to mention, our own John Collins is an honorable mention for #20. 
I. Love. My. Skwa. 
Actually a really good video, even with the slight shade that is thrown at the Skwah
Look obviously I love him but he's not a candidate with guys like Simmons, Mitchell and Tatum this year. 
Everybody understands we're rebuilding, people disagree (including me) that JC is good enough that playing him five more minutes is suddenly gonna make us a winning team, whereas Bud has a long track record of not playing rookies a lot. 
He mentions in the video that he's not actually going to win it.
The thing is this is not the year to gamble. The race at the bottom is packed, tight, and volitile. We have been competitive in alot of our games this year, like less than 5 point games. If we had JC in there those are feasibly wins and we lose out on literally one of the best draft classes in almost a decade. And that's not coming from me. 

We need to remember why we're rebuilding in the first place, to end that soul crushing monotony of never having enough talent to get anywhere really significant.  The bottom line is in this association for a team to win they need a special kind of talent. This draft objectively has the kind of talent that gives teams that and bud understands we need to secure at least one of those talents.
Sure, won't argue much on that. I am talking only for the really really close games. I just highlight Plumlord and Dadditt, because these guys would be at the bench if Collins was playing.
I don't think it's the sole purpose of why we're not playing JC alot, but it's part of it. I would absolutely love to see JC play now minutes and see more baptisms, but I trust bud more
Why do people want to trade Dennis?? Who would be our PG, fucking Delaney?? Taylor?? I guess we could get another pg but why get one when Dennis is on a good deal and already knows the system? Unless it's a good pick, which no one will give us, why? 
I don't think Dennis needs to be the one to carry us, but I think he is definitely good enough to be on a championship team, especially since he's only 24. He's got plenty of offensive weapons, streaky 3 pointer but everything else is solid, defense isn't the best for his position, but it hasn't been a huge problem when there's other good defenders on the court like in the past couple years. As a point guard who can facilitate well and score whenever he wants, he's on a great deal and if in the next few years he becomes the second option like when Paul was here or even third option if things go really well, then I think we're in a great position. We have so many holes that need to be filled in the next couple years, I really don't think starting point guard is what needs to be fixed. Dennis is great, and it seems like that would just be going backwards. Another thing is, Dennis seems to have that extra level he kicks it into whenever he's playing against a top point guard or in playoff games. I just don't see how Dennis is what people want changed on this team. He is our best player, and was our second best player before that. He's 24. He's on contract for 3 more years at 15.5m a year. Got a little carried away here, but Dennis doesn't need to go.
would y'all think trading Dennis for a good big man + a 1st and then drafting Trae Young to be a starting pg be a good plan? 
Any picks for him is good. We're not competing any time soon and he's old and it just doesn't make sense to keep him when we could get something that could help us when we try to compete 
I feel like Dennis can definitely be a third/fourth guy on a contender. GSW has skewed our views on what a championship team needs to consists of but having 4 all-stars on a team is and probably will always be an anomaly. He's also on a great contract for his skill.

I don't think we should give up on him yet, but I also don't think he's untouchable and if we get an offer that is actually good for us we should definitely consider it.
Fair enough 
.5 games ahead of the magic for first overall, just need to keep up the pace
Yes dude that would be great. Add that to our top pick in a loaded draft and you have the beginning of something potentially great
Always liked him during the pre draft process. With Hawks University, he can become something promising. 
3&D I guess but definitely more 3 than D
Wow. This has me very excited to see him in action 
Ohh okay cool thanks for the explanation!
Is this a shot at Cavanaugh? Because he’s better than musky by far 
Nah I’m just saying this is what happens with Hawks 2-way players. We find out they’re good and sign them. 
The rich get richer. 
Eh, if we aren't in the top 5 he would be a p good consolation prize
There are many many reasons why he's an infinitely better prospect than Jimmer. Ball handling, passing, quick release on jumper, much better overall decision making, and quickness to name a few.
Learn how to spell the best player on our teams name LOL
Well, yeah, we're trying to get the best pick in the best draft in practically a decade over here
Could be a nice piece, hopefully developing into a ball handler off the bench. Definitely a potential target for us, especially with our fantastic shooting coach.
I'd take him, ideally with our second round pick, but I'd be cool taking him near the end of the first. He's an interesting prospect, could grow into a player that counters Simmons and Giannis in the future.
My potions aren't fit for daddies, let alone a snek

You need to go to a seller that sells weaker potions
I am not comparing them as players, they just look so much alike lol
I know, that's why I said I know this is a meme. But I'm saying people generally compare the two skill wise, which makes no sense to me
I dont think Prince will ever be a star with his skillset. Maybe an all star but I think his his ceiling is 17/8 with good D and a strong leader
5 COMMENTS IN A HOUR LOL
Do you have a favorite? Sourdough is a good one for sandwiches. 
Right!?! The man had 10 boards in 14 minutes tonight. That’s 28 rebounds per 40 lmao. 
Dennis was in the D-League some his rookie year. JC is by far coach Bud’s most played rook 
Both of them were notably better than their counterparts starting over them even when we're winning. With JC its literally the exact want way
You mean Schroder was better than Teague in his rookie year? Not even close. And for the first two years Teague was clearly better. Third year maybe yes he deserved more mins but still we talk about Teague who was an all star one year before. What is Plumlee even doing on this team? What even one Plumlee minute is good for? 
You're right, how many COTYs do to have? How many years we're you an assistant to one of the greatest basketball coaches ever? Obviously you know more than the guy that had a 60 win season and got to the ECFs. 
Okay so his acolades and experience literally mean nothing. Definitely don't hold any merit at all. Good way of thinking. You can disagree all you want, but don't act like you know what you're talking about. The process works. We don't care about your fantasy team or your bets.
Bigger in the sense that he played like 5 more minutes than he is now yeah, but even at the beginning of the year he wasn't playing real minutes.
Only if we can get the Brooklyn pick they own.
Yeah but Young should go around ~5, Ayton and Doncic both top 3 so that's not gonna happen with the Nets pick
I would take that deal.  I'm in the moving Bazemore is important camp though.  
funny that it's an albatross cus were the hawks. heh
I didn't know that but that makes perfect sense. I think that I would prefer to keep Bazemore just because he seems like a good lockerroom presence but a first round pick would be tempting. That's why I would never be a very good GM though because I tend to overrate our players especially the defensively minded ones
I think a best-case comparison for Ayton might be Boogie Cousins:

* Perfect physical build for the NBA
* Great scorer from anywhere on the floor
* Great rebounder
* Great athlete
* Weaker on defense than you'd like
* Some questions about his mentality
* More of a "one man show" than a "team facilitator"

Despite his weaknesses, I'd be very happy to get Ayton in the top 5, don't get me wrong. That being said, I hesitate to put him above Doncic, partly because I feel like the college game is tailor-made to make those "one man show" type big men look ultra-dominant -- it seems like every year we see a big man who looks like the most dominant force in college hoops, just because he's so much bigger and more physically mature than everyone else around him -- but then once that guy gets into the NBA that's no longer the case anymore and he fails to live up to expectations (players like Okafor and Kanter are the worst examples here; and obviously Ayton is a lot more athletic than either of those guys, but you get my point).

Part of it too is that given the rules of the modern NBA, I'm not so sure you can have a title-worthy team that revolves around a big scoring Center being the focal point of your offense anymore. Nowadays it seems like all the legitimate contenders are being led by MVP-caliber ball-handling wings, not big men. The optimal role for a big man on a title-worthy team nowadays seems to be someone more like a Draymond Green or a Serge Ibaka, who can defend the paint, grab rebounds, and use his passing and/or floor stretching abilities to amplify the strengths of the superstar ball-handlers whose scoring abilities are the real focal point of the offense. Honestly, guys like Ilyasova and Dedmon are exactly the type of big men I think work best on championship-worthy teams. (Or in the case of this draft, guys like Jaren Jackson or Wendell Carter or whoever.)

When it comes to Doncic, though, I absolutely could see him being that "focal point" type of player that the entire offense revolves around. I posted this earlier, but I'll repost it here:

> You know, I've been trying to come up with a good player comparison for Luka Doncic... and I was kind of surprised to see how many similarities there are between him and James Harden, of all people. I haven't watched enough of Doncic to know whether I'm way off base here, but from what I'm hearing it seems like there are some interesting parallels, at least:
> 
> * Similar size and build
> * Good perimeter shooter
> * Good rebounder
> * Built like a wing but with the ball-handling and distributing/playmaking abilities of a point guard
> * Not known for defensive abilities but so dominant on offense that it makes up for it and then some
> * Doesn't beat opponents with explosive speed (like Wall) or above-the-rim acrobatics (like Westbrook) but instead uses a crafty kind of herky-jerky game that throws defenders off balance (Harden was considered a fairly "meh" athlete coming into the draft)
> * Loves drawing contact in the lane and has a knack for getting calls that no one else seems to get (although making direct comparisons here is tricky because the European rules are different)

Obviously developing into an MVP-caliber player like Harden would be a best-case scenario for Doncic, to say the least -- but I do think it shows that a very high ceiling is at least possible for a player like him. Plus, the more of him I see, the more it seems like all the talk about his defense and athleticism are a bit exaggerated. True, he's not the *best* defender or the *most* athletic guy in the world, but his defense and athleticism do seem decent enough to be called average -- they don't seem bad enough to make him a liability, at least. His size and his motor/hustle seem like they'll help him a lot in that regard. When it comes to Ayton, though... I don't know, I just feel like I'd be a lot more enamored with him if I knew he was bringing great defense to the table in addition to all his other talents. I can live with less-than-stellar defense for my premier scoring SG, but it's something I think is really important for a C. Does that make sense?

Anyway, the real thing that pushed me over the top for Doncic recently was when I read that [he's number one -- by far -- in points per possession on pick-and-rolls.](https://cleaningtheglass.com/midseason-draft-review-luka-doncic/) Number one! And given the fact that we just drafted the NBA's next great roll man in John Collins, I can get a very clear picture of what our endgame would look like with this team if we drafted Doncic: non-stop spamming the Doncic-Collins PnR like they're the newest incarnation of Nash-Stoudemire or Stockton-Malone, with Taurean Prince spotting up in the corner for kick-out three after kick-out three. It's just too much fun to imagine.

Long story short, I'd still be cool with Ayton. He does seem to have all the right tools to be a superstar, no doubt about it. But I don't necessarily feel that much stronger about him than I do about any of the other guys in the top 10. I'd try to get Doncic first, maybe Young or MPJ second (it's harder to figure out what exactly MPJ will end up looking like, but that's a whole other story), and after that [I'd honestly consider listening to offers from any team that might be willing to trade up from \(say\) #8 to #4.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AtlantaHawks/comments/7mq1du/scenarios_where_youd_actually_be_willing_to_trade/)

My opinions on this draft change a lot though, so I could feel completely different about all this a month from now. Just kind of thinking out loud here.

**EDIT:** I will say I did see one comment recently about Ayton's defense that was encouraging:
> As for the knock on him written above re: blocked shots, I would ascribe that less to Ayton and more to the system he plays in. Miller is a disciple of the pack-line defense, which values positioning and responsibility. Weakside help for blocked shots (ie where most post guys get their blocks) is not a staple of that defense. Miller has had his share of 7 ft players and super athletic bigs, but Arizona is typically at the middle our bottom of the P12 in blocked shots. He’d rather have those players be in position for rebounds and boxing out their men. So, don’t ding Ayton on that just yet.

So that was good to see. This may turn out to be one of those happy scenarios where either choice is a great choice.
The very fact that you think his ceiling is Brandon roy or Joe Johnson shows me you haven't watched many of his highlights at all.

Please do more research and come back to us before spouting ignorance 
Wow this was great and I wish I had enough time to respond to everything you said.

One question though: which of the prospects do you think have the best chance to be the face of a franchise or be the cornerstone for a franchise?
Ayton could turn out to be Greg Oden and Doncic has been playing against better competition for a long time now compared to everyone else in this draft.
Size: Ayton > Doncic


Athleticism: Ayton > Doncic


Strength: Ayton > Doncic


Upside: Ayton > Doncic


Defense: Ayton > Doncic


NBA ready: Ayton > Doncic


Field goal efficiency: Ayton > Doncicc


3 point shooting percentage: Ayton (33.3%) > Doncic (32.9%)


Passing: Doncic > Ayton (Ayton is a good passer, but Doncic is better)


Playmaking: Doncic > Ayton


NBA comparison: DeAndre Ayton (Healthy Joel Embiid), Luka Doncic (Bigger Manu Ginobili)
The fact that you compared him to Roy actually makes me like him more. The dude was destined for greatness if he only loved his body more than his team.
Ayton is relatively safe also. While Doncic have a higher floor, Ayton have a much much higher ceiling.
If you wanted to predict that Ayton would have a better chance than Doncic of becoming the cornerstone of his franchise, that's fair enough. I'm just not convinced he'd have a better chance of becoming the best player on a *championship* franchise, if that makes sense. Sort of the same way I feel about Boogie. Face of his team? Absolutely, no doubt. Best player on a championship team? Not so sure...

Like I said though, I'm saying all this with like, 70% confidence at best. A lot of people around here seem convinced that they know exactly how each one of these players is going to turn out. I definitely do not share that mindset. I'm just sort of giving my vague impressions here.
The difference is doncic is a significantly better passer than JJ ever was already. Luka is averaging more assists and better vision at the age of 18 than Joe ever did at any point in his career. 

Stop pushing this Joe Johnson comparison, it's simply incorrect
You literally just answered your own question on the first point, because he doesn't have a shot.

 Yes. Ben Simmons. The point forward that can assist and rebound with the best of them as well as score. That's if I HAD to make a comparison. 

His skillset is what make him so different. His combination of shooting, passing, size, strength, craftyness, vision, and BBIQ along with his experience have never been seen before in this league in this era at the level he's producing at this age. Please find me someone that truely accounts for all of this at his age coming into the league.

Edit: you keep assuming his iso scoring is what makes him so good, which is, again, incorrect. It's EVERYTHING else that makes him special, on top of his scoring. Using JJ as a comparison is straight lazy and not accounting for everything else he does very well
Good article, I’m still just iffy on this guy. I mean I’m sure you’re aware but this pick needs to be the face of the franchise and be the cornerstone for a great future. Is Doncic that guy ? Or will he just only ever be very good just like JJ in his prime. I would hope he could be like James Harden given that he also isn’t an explosive Athlete but has sneaky quickness and great shooting and passing skills. 

I just think if we have the number 1 pick we need to get the guy with the highest potential rather than great talent right now and a low ceiling.
I'm still pissed about that travel call. We need to lose games but damn if I'm not pissed that Dennis had one of his best games get overshadowed by a loss.
Here’s one more currently looking for more from this season [YoYo2](https://youtu.be/T9fhIYaNnVM) 
how does that even work it's some dang magic
Yaaaa I’m good on that trade . We have Schroder and fultz is going thru too much right now ,
Lovely picture selection at the top of that article. 
I’d take anything for them. They make the team too good and I want them gone. Get Marco, Ersan, Dedmon, and Babbit the F off this team.
If they're willing to take on a two-year contract, they'd probably get a first off some team.
Shout out to the twolves that gave us a first rounder this year for that guy
Babbitt has to play to make the team good, which he hasn't in the last three weeks
I'd be okay with keeping dedmon if nothing more than mentoring JC but everyone else needs to go to greener pastures
His shooting splits this year have been much better than his last 3 or so years, I think he's honestly been our best big this year. He's definitely on the block if youre interested enough
RJ: So how you guys doin'?

> Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

this season summed up lmao
Best episode yet. So dumb that they cannot cuss though.
also can we trade someone for RJ just so he can be the third host because I love this podcast but having someone with actual charisma would be good.
Still got first pick and got buds 200th win :D
:)
Looks like a win to celebrate my birthday! I dunno, I’m in a suite with open bar and drunk right now. Go Hawks!
Why not add more big men to the hawks roster 😂
I don't see much value on that trade. Blazers can't offer us prospects, aside 2018 first round pick, because their only valuable young player is Zach Collins and we already have the good Collins! We don't need more big men, because even if Dedmon leaves, there is still Musci and Plumlee. 
Now that would be something; if we could get a #11 or #12 pick, that might even be enough to trade up into the top 8 and grab us a Sexton or a JJJ. That'd be pretty sweet.
It's more about getting rid of Baze's contract and opening up capspace next year. We don't need anything this year since we're losing anyways.
>It's more about getting rid of Baze's contract and opening up capspace next year. We don't need anything this year since we're losing anyways.

>It's more about getting rid of Baze's contract and opening up capspace next year. We don't need anything this year since we're losing anyways.


I literally, and I'm not joking, have no clue how I commented this. I think it was a pocket comment.

I did not type this lmao. 
http://www.tankathon.com/

estimated 3 first rounders, 4 if you count #31 pick as a first rounder.
Ours

Minnesota first

Houston first
best chance for that is to package 28/21 and like Dedmon/Ilyasova to Cleveland/Boston and take one of their shitty contracts, but still unlikely to happen anyway. I could see Dedmon+Ilyasova + 21 pick for Shumpert + Brooklyn(top 3 protected) I guess if Cleveland really wants to win now.
Houston top 3 protected, wolves lottery protected
Ahh pitiful, maybe we can dump a vet for another first 
We’re anything but competitive if we’re being honest, but I guess what I mean is we mostly depend on one offensive tactic and it’s easy to figure
It's more to be retooling this year more than be competitive, but I agree the point is to be easy to beat with giving the least amount of information on our plays as possible
Idk I really like kidds style and I think it might just fit us
Or here: https://soaringdownsouth.com/2017/04/12/quantifying-effect-mike-budenholzer/

Or here, in which he's called the best ATO coach in the league: http://thebasketballplaybook.com/basketball-playbooks/mike-budenholzer-atlanta-hawks-playbook/

That sentiment is echoed here: https://hashtagbasketball.com/atlanta-hawks/content/guide-to-watching-the-tanking-hawks

He gets high marks for it on nba.com: http://www.nba.com/article/2017/05/29/morning-tip-what-makes-great-after-timeout-play-nba#/

Back with the Spurs, his plays were called "Coach Bud specials": http://blog.mysanantonio.com/spursnation/2010/12/03/budenholzer-draws-up-play-on-critical-basket/

In other words, I don't think you know what you're taking about on this point. 

Bud is a top 5 coach and our most valuable asset outside of the First Round Pick (yes more than Dennis or JC) while Kidd is actively sabotaging his potentially great team. 


Media praises everyone. Case in point, your NBA article lists **10** head coaches that are excellent at calling ATO plays.

I'm not springing for a Synergy subscription to measure performance across multiple seasons, but[here are some actual stats on effectiveness I were able to find for the 2015-2016 season](http://i.imgur.com/ZrDFe39.png). Bud ranks squarely in the middle of the pack. Talent will have a huge factor on these rankings, but we were not particularly untalented that season (finished at 48 wins).

Bud is still living off reputation from that 60 win season, before everyone solved for his action in Feb 2015.
/u/widesheep [actually made a post about how bad Kidd is](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/7l0t02/reasons_why_jason_kidd_should_be_fired/). Besides that our player development is already great - we talk about Hawks University working wonders a bunch - we have one of the best development systems there is in the NBA and Bud is a huge part in that.
Bud is a Top 5-8 coach, but that doesn't mean he's a top 5-8 coach in calling plays out of timeouts.

Re: talent it's not like Quin Snyder or Rick Carlisle are dealing with KD-tier talent, yet both finished Top 5.

I don't see why we have to pretend that Bud is above any criticism, he is in aggregate a phenomenal coach but everyone has flaws and weaknesses.


I love how dedmon has been taking JC under his wing this year. He's a good mentor for him
Expectant sure but it hurts the same every time 
Games are never fully sold out at Philips, but if you want to play it safe go ahead and buy now 
The games are never sold out on NBAtickets.com and they're never fake
Would you recommend those seats at that price?  

I'll let you know if I get them in case you're free to say hi!

Edit - I had another quick look this morning and managed to see some in section 122, row G, for $144 plus fees.  So I've bought them!
I’m commenting after your edit, but to answer your question, yes I would recommend those seats. You can certainly see the floor from there and they are inexpensive. However, seems like you got some nice seats for just a bit more! Nice!
I can now ‘lol’ at these comments now I’ve just watched the commercial! You guys!
Lol no one is going to take plumlee because bud makes him "look good" he is an extremely negative asset
However this goes, we need more defensive players
>draft trae young


because our pick will be top 3 so we can get a better player than that


>trade Dennis for Boogie

Cousins won't re-sign in Atlanta in a million billion years with this team.

So many salty sailors mad that were getting a top 3 pick in one of the best drafts in almost a decade😂😂😂
with Trae Young hype and John Collins getting better and better, he might, it'd be worth a shot. If not him then that's why i said another good big man 
Trae Young college hype is fun and he might become a great player but he has no defense and his even though he's scoring like crazy his shot and finishing aren't anything to write home about, he'd be like a better version of Dennis at best imo while we have the opportunity to get an actual star with Doncic/Ayton/Bagley/Porter.
England should really do a better job of educating its prisoners tbh
Great win. Couldn’t ask for much better than scoring one less point than the other guys.
Ahhhh I love this team:)
If I didn't know any better I'd say we're tanking.
2 wins tonight
Who TF are you lol. You've never even posted on here before. 
Yeah, but what's one person in comparison to Nick Saban sacrificing a village worth of people?
Dude, no. He's doing this on purpose to keep the tank moving but to stay competitive as well. LOL

Maybe the fact that I'm willing to do so the team and all the other fans would be happy

Maybe the football gods appreciate that sort of thing
And today, I learned there is a more petty fanbase than the Celtics. Or is this just par for the course
I haven't seen too much of these players, but if possible Doncic would be nice. The writer mentions the main reason I prefer Doncic: he's been competing against grown-ass men. He's not as athletic as the rest of the prospects, but consider that along with the fact that he's performing well against more developed players, and he looks like one spicy prospect.

In the end, I'll probably be pretty happy with our pick, the top end of this draft is beautiful.
Ayton / Doncic will make this year 1000% worth it, you could make a very compelling case for either of these guys to go to us and have the most impact but I personally think Doncic is the BPA of this draft 
Daddy Doncic is also some nice alliteration 
No they didn't Rubio's best year in Europe was slightly worse than Doncic's first. And although Rubio was a great defender in Europe his offense has never been close to what Luka is doing, actually practically no one in Europe has been doing what Luka is doing. 

Rubio was a great young contributor to a top Euroleague team at a young age, Doncic is the star of the second best league in the world.
Need to get some more pieces around the core Collins.
Luka might be a SF or even a Ben Simmons style point forward in the NBA but yeah he plays the 2 in Europe. However we're getting rid of them because the ones we have aren't great, overpaid and getting old. I don't think it has much to with who we wanna draft - it's true that neither Baze or Marco are in our future plans though.
That's true, I guess I just thought everyone would know what they're getting with him by now
Dedmon is much better than Splitter tho
Oh you're right, I didn't know that, I wouldn't mind keeping him anyways
Will we be the first to 40 wins?
Taurean Prince has 14 points on 4/7 3pt shooting in 19 minutes so thats good news.
Nice late start time, maybe we'll be able to grab some hawks action after the Natty?
That shot was sexy
The amount this sub is freaking out over a player hitting 1 three is completely appropriate. Praise be. 
i believe it, I mean from what I've seen of his free-throws and rare midrange jumpers, he has a solid form. He really needs to shoot more of those midrangers instead of looking to pass every time he gets the ball more than 2 ft away from the basket lol

Hoodie Collins confirmed.

Hey Hawks fans, thanks for letting us win, i hope yall get the first pick next year and make good use of it,  wish just the best for you.

And also the Hawks commentator are nice
Very very very important win. Puts some separation between us and LA(Aka Boston) in the retooling standings 
Now we are truly the most powerful team in the league, who will step up to compete... Talk about retooling, absolute art. 
Ayton would be a better fit imo, but we're not gonna pass up on an 18 y/o putting up MVP numbers in the second hardest league in the world
I'm still on the Doncic train but let's also not forget Porter and Bagley who are still very much in the running.
Doncic but I would be extremely happy with Ayton too
We are 3-24 our last 27 games Fournier, Vuc, Simmons, AG, Ross and Isaac all have missed a bunch of games. I would be happy with any of these 6 prospects Doncic, Ayton, Bagley, Porter, Bamba or Young they all have franchise level potential.
Doncic is a beast he would be a good option for you guys. 
And Doncic would be an amazing fit with Collins. P&R for days.
Really? I feel like they would fit fine together. Move JC to his more natural PF and let Ayton pound the paint with his length, while he can also move outside and JC can sit in the paint for other sets

They would have some inherent defensive flaws, but I think if we can teach THJ how to play defense, we can teach them as well
I think they're a perfectly fine fit actually. 
Bud would love him that's for sure, I think with him developing Luka he would be something really special in this league
Yeah I guess if Popovich can make Gasol/Aldridge work than Collins & Ayton should be fine given their freak athleticism for their size 
JC reminds me of Amare he is the perfect 5 in the small ball era. I think Doncic is the type of player Bud would want he is smart and versatile.
Make that the ATL "four picks in the top 35" Hox
On the bright side Dennis already has 18 points.
Would Ayton/Bamba fit with Collins? Laker fan here, John looks like a legit core piece
Yikes lol
Al pulling a KD with a burner account right now?
It's a meme lmao calm down
Yea like grabbing rebounds when it matters and winning us championships... Oh wait
Not a Falcons fan but my team isn't in the playoffs so bring it home for the city boys! Would be nice to get the ATL sports curse lifted 
More like isaiah staylor am i right fellas
Gotta have people in the stands first #gotem
I’m pretty sure it was snek 
Delaney + Taylor is actually our best Net Rating lineup
Soon to be on best starting bigs list
Soon to be on best player list 
Perfectly executed game
we're almost halfway through the season... stay strong boys
dorsey and moose played so that's fun i guess
Congratulations dude I hope you enjoyed the win as much as I did
I'm not a hawks or blazers fan but this post makes me so happy for some reason 
Damn, we're so good we made the NFL's playoffs!
This is the best sub in the nba! Lmao! 
Damn crowd really came out tonight. Guess that's just how it is when the best team in the league comes to town. 
Lol wow.. This is rough
Happy national bird day to all my fellow Hawk enthusiasts!
both scallops hotel and jeff rosenstock have released albums in 2018 already and they're great
Honestly i don't know why schroeder would be getting shopped around 
I share your sentiments. If we move too many guys for only picks we're going to stretch this process out for years. I don't think Schlenk plans on retooling for more than 2 years.
THANK YOU!! Trading every good player is not the way to tank. We have a good young point guard.
I wouldn’t say he is a solid defender. If his defence was better then he would have much more value. I’m pretty sure he’s almost bottom of the league in defence. 
Because he’s putting up the numbers he is because he is having a very high usage rate, and I’m an ideal situation, he will never have the usage rate he is having right now again. This could very well be the ideal time to sell Dennis high as I’ve said since before the season. He’s not Schlenk’s hand chosen PG, so there’s a good chance he’s not the Hawks’s future.

# PrayForTrae
Collins is more valuable than Prince by a long shot
Thankfully i think we can safely say both of them aren't going anywhere
 MCW fell off hard after his rookie year. Jrue is still good now on the pelicans. Schroder is in his second year getting starter minutes and is still being productive. I would never trade someone young that i know is going to score, to draft someone that is hopefully better or can match his production
Well no way that happens.*Maybe* if we packaged every pick we have that wasn’t originally ours with him 
Yeah Jrue is still good but that's why they traded him. They saw he was too good to tank but not a future superstar.
I like your post

I enjoy reading your post. This is my favorite kind of post

When I read this post, I think to myself "yes".

When I see someone say they like sneks, I think to myself "no".
Eagles can fly

Hawks can try

But that's about it.
Depends on their development. I bet the 6ers are glad they let Dario saric develop in the euroleague alittle before letting him loose in the NBA
Just have to force Griffin to his left, easy.
Better yet, 2 hands of poker. Only condition is they send Griffin. 
Honestly as much as I want to lose games, I would much rather lose them in games that we keep close and never truly have a shot at winning vs being up by 7 we with 1:40 to go and losing that way. 
that was amazing holy shit I love Dennis
[Now let's be fair to Dennis, he maintains a very sophisticated thought process at all times](https://i.imgur.com/N1pCnqm.jpg)
or the highest? we've been on too much of a win streak
No he has the highest. He understands that the median outcome for draft picks 1-5 are significantly better than later in the lottery. He also understands that beginning in the 2019 draft, tanking will not be as effective with the new lottery odds so we have to lose games this year.
I like showing teams that we could easily crush them if we weren't trying to remain competitive. 
he didn't fall to the ground either lol, the suns made the right play
He wasn't amazing in the last quarter but Baze had a pretty great game
To help boost Ilyasova, Bumlee, & possibly even Dedmons trade value. Tho honestly i'd keep Dedmon
I honestly don’t think so . He might get a start or two if injuries comes up but even in his most dominate games he hardly is breaking 20 mins. 
Collins is good but not 'win us games by playing ten more minutes' good
He's nineteen and could use the experience. Im not saying Thibs minutes but Plumlee should not be playing more than him in any scenario.
Per 36 minutes he was averaging 18 and 12 at one point, so if our guards remember he does more than dunk on pick & rolls he'll be a lot more productive than Plumlee.
Really impressive that he's dominating the Euroleague at such a young age
If that isn't a sign that we're becoming a Slovenian sub in June I don't know what is.
Very true... maybe that’s why they didn’t go with Jesse?
holy tank LMFAO!!!

dennis just intentionally or accidentally drove the lane for a layup needing 3 points lmao
Can we build a better tank than the Russians?
Honestly if his hair was a little shorter 
They better blow this thing. Get every decent player with more than 3 years in the league out of town
Thanks for a top 5 pick this year. Let's see how your LeBron/PG/Cousins or bust plan works. 
good thing usernames in titles don't send the person a message so koo won't see this likely ever
You should have made me a mod. I know CSS and I have no ulterior motives for wanting access to the /r/AtlantaHawks ~~secure channels~~ mod tools.
You need to take your ‘secure channels’ conspiracy theory elsewhere bucko
Need some love for United up in here
A+ meme, very relevant.
All three teams made the playoffs in their first year playing at MBS. SeemsGood
Well I guess we will win in June with Luka Doncic
I think we can make the playoffs if we sign a couple guys and get our draft pick right.
The good old spurs tank strategy. 
Honestly, any of them would be a nice shot of talent.
Doncic

Best basketballer.
Ayton but I would like for him to develop his 3’s more.
Or MPJ if he's healthy
Guards win championships in this day and age

It's funny because they said the same thing about Nash and he got 2 MVPs lol

Centers can still have a great pretty big impact, even if they aren't finding much success right now.
Can we stop winning games please? We need to bench Budenholzer.
We need a new meme, winning games are fun for 1 to 2 days but it will fuck up years of happiness in the future. 


Our undefeated meme was cool, but we need a fresh new one to stop this winning streak...
We need to trade Ilyasova and Belinelli. They've been playing well and might win us a few too many games
The only player I would be okay with taking if we didn't take doncic. I bet this was one of the guys schlenk brought up when he was trying to convince bud to retool
Honestly its astounding the Plumlee got 12.5 per, like damn who's his agent and did he take the Bucks owner hostage or something 
SMH at that Kent B. Salary. Happy that he got his payday, but he will never be able to reach the expected level of play with this roster.
What about everybody’s favorite hawk, Tyler Cavanaugh?
bazemore and plumlee should be playing for free
KB is a perfect 6  on a good team. Unfortunately that we are not
lol whats the point of voting for hawks
I have him behind Doncic, and Ayton right now should we get the number one pick but this is a great year to retool while remaining competive
You know dominating college with less physicality is a plus right. Ayton should be way more dominant with a NBA body. Bagley is 2-3 years away from a NBA body.
John Collins is actually a more efficient shooter than Bagley. Bagley just takes more
Chill with that. John Collins is the greatest player to ever touch a basketball. But I like Bagley a ton. It’s just I think he’s in the same class with other guys who fit better with the long term pieces we have. That’s the tiebreaker 
Dear Hawks,

Stop winning.

Thanks.
IT'S THE BLESSING

72-26 CONFIRMED BOYS
They don't think the lottery be like it is, but it do.  I just like to see the boys win.
it was more like during Lil-B curse? 0 chips

Dawg his shot selection was trash lol this is who y'all want 

Lou Williams 2.0?

I thought I was an atheist, but now I’m not so sure
It's okay. When you find the truth you been denying for so long. We will get John to baptize you and cleanse your doubt 
We could set Dennis free and rebuild a little longer. It would hurt, but Dennis and one or more of spare 1st that aren't ours might do it.
For top 6? Doubt it
Memes aside, it's awesome seeing how well John Collins has performed after falling all the way to #19. The Blazers traded picks #20 and #15 for #10 from the Kings to draft Zach Collins, and while John doesn't shoot 3s and is a 6'10" PF rather than a true 7' center, he's been a more efficient player with less support, while playing more minutes. Much has been said about Donovan Mitchell and Kyle Kuzma, but I don't think a lot of people appreciate how well John Collins is playing given what's being asked of him.
8 comments for the best game we've played all year ugh
Why doesnt the coach unleash John Collins for more minutes? 
This ball movement has been beautiful 
I'd be happy if he got more but I think as long as he's getting more than 20 every game with some 30 min. games he's getting enough exposure to develop.
The one year Pistons, Bulls, or Celtics weren’t in our way, we have the best record in the East, Nique is leading MVP voting, and we fucking trade him. Nice 
Tried posting this on r/nba but it got removed for some reason. Thought it was pretty interesting so figured id post it here.
inb4 we draft a superstar this season and build an amazing team just to blow it up in the season that we can finally compete
Way more substantive than this sub deserves. Shame on you for bringing your quality discourse here. We don’t need it.
The Bucks traded Ray Allen in his prime for a old Gary Payton rental. Trust me, as a Bucks fan I know how you feel lol
I can see it now. The year is 2027 and. Lebron has just retired after 10-peating. Our superstar, nicknamed “retooling while remaining competitive” (doesn’t have the ring of the process but oh well) is 29 and leading the MVP race. Atlanta looks like it’s finally gonna win a championship, but no we trade him for cash considerations 
Maybe you know this, but you can just multiply 82 by win percentage to find that out. 82 * .257 = 21 wins

Those 538 projections are based on more than current record, though. Mostly BS in my opinion. 
[this one is good too](https://imgur.com/gallery/wkTaZ) 
lmao
Yup. Baze and I have been going steady since October ;) 
Ah ok. 
Man this would make playoff games in the future so much more lit 
Lol Hawks players couldn't care less 
Came from the Raptors stream. Apparently the ATL hawks coaches weren't happy with OG stealing and dunking at the end. Was saying it to Dwane Casey, who fired back his own, and the one caught on Camera was Bud saying back to Dwane again. 

Edit: here's the raptors perspective: https://www.reddit.com/r/torontoraptors/comments/7mz1wp/casey_with_some_choice_word_for_atlanta_bench/ 
Ah okay I couldn't tell if it was directed to the ref or Casey.  Thanks.
here's the full video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FJzZ6fbZgw&feature=youtu.be&ab_channel=NAK
If he could get us 30/10 on 16 shots every game he'd be in the mvp discussion lol. Forreal though he has a nice layup package, hope he just keeps hitting his threes and defense.
Lol I just sent a trade for him in my fantasy league earlier today. Gonna go ahead n cancel that...
ASAP lol 
Howard never would have came and we would be in a really good spot right now I think 
For me Luka should be our pick if we have a shot at him.  Kid is supremely talented and has been playing against men for awhile. He also can shoot the 3 and stretch the court and just feel like he fits current NBA better than some of the other top prospects 
[I was thinking of the same thing the other day;](https://www.reddit.com/r/AtlantaHawks/comments/7lvg5c/ok_how_about_this_plan/) Bol is a unique prospect for sure. Obviously it's way too early to tell how he'll look a year and a half from now, but still I agree with your basic premise that we cannot and should not just tank for one year and then declare mission accomplished and start trying to add quality veterans and win games again. In my view, the right way to do it is to keep tanking until your young star draftees are so good that they're winning too many games all by themselves for you to tank anymore even if you wanted to. That's when you know you're ready to stop tanking and start adding role players -- when you have no ability to do otherwise.
Honestly id rather do everything in our power to get Bamba rather than try to get bol next year. Bamba would end up being a much better defensive prospect and his shooting stroke looks much better than bols
Nah aim for ayton, I know doncic looks good in the euro pros but it does not change the face that he's a 6'8 SG and I just don't know if he has the athleticism at the size to be more than a spot up shooter in the league. Plus his defence is already suspect against far less athletically gifted players in Europe. Idk I like him but I'm so unsure about him. Ayton has an NBA body already and is athletic asf for a center and already has a jumpshot. He looks like sure talent to me.
His 3% has gone down this year but his usage minutes and points are all up. He’s not the fastest guard but he has great length and size to him where he should be able to stay in front of the quicker guards. I think the experience he has gained will help him transition faster as opposed to other incoming rookies in the class. 
To be fair, Ayton does set pitiful screens. That’s the only thing I have to say in the negative about him. Other than that, I’d be happy taking Ayton or Doncic. 
That was a good read and I’m glad I’m not the only one who thinks bol has a huge upside. I agree that we should stash doncic for a year or rest porter like what the 76ers did with Simmons and embiid. It gave them time to practice and get stronger before coming into the league. Simmons even grew last year during his time off. 
Very true. I have no doubts he can learn, it would just be more reassuring if he already did things that way. I’m sure Travis will make the best decision so I’m not worried. 
He also wears long socks and sexy shorts, so there’s that. 
Schlenk: "Hey Bud, we've been winning too many games lately, at this rate we may not have a bottom-4 record."

Bud: "Shit, better give Pluplee more minutes."
Looked at the boxscores, Baze with that incredible 15 turnovers per 36.
Prince is pretty good
You beat me to it this time. Next time I’m posting it at 12:01 AM EST. Good luck. You have one day. 
We’ll just call it a friendly competition and nobody needs to mod-abuse anyone. 
i'm already a trash mod so i only need one more letter
"Daddy Doncic" does have a nice ring to it
This kid is so good really hope we end up getting him.  Think he just fits better in the modern NBA than several of the other top prospects
I’ve also heard they are much more strict on what is considered an assist. But I really wouldn’t know
Good morning fans of the number 3 team in the nation. What a beautiful morning to be in the Rose Bowl
sure is something
good thing that most new years resolutions fail then
Proven young star on a good contract. Top 3 pick is just too valuable. 
I honestly don't see any situation where we can fesibly trade back that would be in the best interest of our future, but man the more I think about trading back up into the top 10 the more I think we need to.

Like could you imagine getting Doncic and then trading back up and nabbing Bamba? The combination of Luka's offense and Bamba's defense right off the bat? I don't think it's crazy to think we could contend for a playoff spot immediately with the team we already have
Hard to argue with that. I guess it all just comes down to whether there's a player still on the board when it's your turn to pick that you really believe can become that superstar. If not, then ok, maybe you trade down, but if you think you've found your guy, then you take him, end of story.

This post is probably just revealing more about my own doubts than anything else, because lately I've slowly starting going from "anyone in the top five would be perfect and amazing and I would be happy forever" to second-guessing whether some of these top-5 guys are really "YES THIS IS THE GUY THIS IS THE CHOSEN ONE" in my mind after all or not.
But why trade away Schroder, he’s still young constantly improving and willing to stay with us during a rebuild. I’d rather keep a nice point guard then trade him away for a maybe. Most drafts only produce 1 all star 2 if it’s a really good class.
True it would probably be Dennis or an inclusion of prince who is showing a lot of potential this year. I’m kind of hoping that mpj falls out of the top 10 with his back injury. I would risk a 11-15 on him. 
To be fair, Ersan does the same thing whenever we play them...
Well, good thing we don't have a losing record.
[You’ll all be thanking me when this is over because I stood my ground and fought the good fight.](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_QzLLFScfQMM/TB5xOvCqHzI/AAAAAAAAAIE/9mnmiflLVcw/s1600/page2captainamerica.jpg)
Hornets trade a first for Bellinelli and Plumlee. Slurs trade a first for Dedmon
We had 13 more rebounds than them.... and I thought rebound daddy left us.
Good win fellas but Deandre falling out of the rotation is a bit concerning 
I know it's been said before but this is the most 2000s picture ever
I can’t believe people don’t think he’s a good enough pg for a good to elite team. Yeah he’s not steph curry but on a team where he is forced to at times carry the load offensively he does very well with what he has around him. 
Yeah I understand that for sure. But I think Schlenk is a great assessor of talent looking at what he did at Golden Stats and his first draft pick with the Hawks. I'm confident he'll make the right selections
Bembry has been good when he plays though. Wish bud would give him more minutes
Love. When will they wear them? When will they be available for purchase??
I think it looks good. Nothing special but really only a few of the city jerseys are. Not a jersey guy but I would wear something with those design elements.
pretty gud
nah the Nique jerseys are objectively the best
my greatest fear is that those uniforms will never be revived and we will be stuck with the Pistol Pete throwbacks for eternity
Nice win to stay “competitive “
Skwa was looking sexy out there tonight 
Do they sell John Collins jerseys in stores? Nice! 
SPOILERS:  We won.

Edit:  Holy shit, we didn't just win... we actually *won*-won.

Hawks Celtics 2008 Series. Nothing easy 
I've only been a dedicated Hawks fan for about 2 years so my favorite memory is the one where John Collins wins the NBA finals MVP in a year or two
Make this subreddit great again👌🏿
(Also Westbrook is trash) rest his soul...
by far my favorite moment for the Hawks so far. That's the day THJ became my favorite player and my love for him hasn't really died down
I’m in love 
I don’t know how the Hawks had the best uniforms in the NBA until 2007. Like there were several great uniforms they just kept changing until it got bad 
These were leaked in NBA Live a few months ago, [here](http://www.nba-live.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nbalive18_hawks_classic.png) and [here](http://www.nba-live.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nbalive18_suns_classic.png) are some screenshots that let you see more of the uniform.  Soooo cleann fucking love these
i’m ok with whatever plan as long as we lock bembry in to this org
I mean I like this plan, but without stashing Luke or sitting MPJ. MPJ is probably going to play in this college season, so sitting him for health reasons wouldn’t work hopefully. And next season would really be a bummer without watching the top rookie. I don’t want to win, so that’s all the joy of it.
Yeah, realistically there's probably no way we'd be able to pull an Embiid-type move where we hold our star draft pick out for his entire first year (and of course stashing Doncic is even more implausible)... I just enjoy trying to come up with ways for us to get more than one top-5 pick. Probably the simplest way would just be to make sure we don't add any quality veterans next year who would help us win extra games, and tank the old-fashioned way; but coming up with harebrained scenarios like this is more fun.
Lol that would potentially be a minor flaw in this plan then
Zach LaVine might be an option depending on his recovery and how much the Bulls would be willing to spend.
money that the lakers and sixers and bulls will also have, there's not a whole lot of young good FA's this upcoming off-season
A good coach good ownership and a nice young core should help a little. Especially since we should be adding a top tier player in the draft as well 
tank you very much
We have best German
And tank you for helping our young core develop more while we still are #1 in the tankathon rankings! 
It's open and shut to me. He needs an inspirational text from Quavo demanding 30 and he will do it
lmao, yall got the best subreddit
If he gets hot he might get it by the all star break 
I love coming here
I think we can safely consider him a bust if he doesn't tbh
Nice pathos bro
Love me some baze! Dude busts his ass all the time, only reason to trade him is if we get an offer that just can’t be passed up 
We cannot get a draft pick for Baze on his current deal lol we'd have to give them along with him. 

I'm okay with both trading him and keeping him but might as well keep him now. 
If we can get a good return on him (lottery pick) I have no problem with trading Dennis. He's great and I love him but his defense is an issue and if it gives us a chance at getting Sexton or Young on top of our own top 3 pick than let's go.
Alright well if that's true sure take it but I still highly doubt any team is wants to get 18 mil/yr for three more seasons Baze for 'a scoring punch' 
That’s basically the ideal game from a retooling while remaining competitive team
delaney looked good. 2 late tho, I doubt we resign him. Taylor didn't shoot the ball well but I missed this aggressive side of him. Good to see him start attacking the rim again. Bembry has been a massive disappointment thus far, the dude is a walking turnover. 

Bazemore, Beli, & Ilyasova are doing a great job of raising their trade value. Honestly, if Baze can keep up this level of play I dont mind keeping him. He's obviously expensive but he's a nice player to have on the bench.
Man I really wanted us to win that after that elbow from Russ
Me too tbh. Dude was way too reckless out there, it got to some of our guys too. I'm willing to bet if bud let Dennis play we would have taken the W
Delaney's trade value isn't even worth an open pack of spearmint gum so good luck trading him lol
No one really knows who our front office likes but the fans seem to want Doncic or Bagley. I'd be fine with Ayton or even MPJ as well. I do trust Schlenk to make the right pick though 
He’d be nice to have in a couple years. But he’s definitely going to bolt for a contender, so we should get whatever we can for him.
ROFL. Well, if we get 4 more games like that we can get a pack of Rap Snacks with a Dab of Ranch.
Milwaukee... never mind that’s just too much of an easy layup
Golden State Worriers
Borlando Magic
Hot pockets
So many possibilities. 
This is a good one.

If you don't begin listening to all 100 Sufjan Christmas songs at exactly 7:15:14 on Christmas Eve so you finish at the exact moment that the greatest day of the year begins, then don't call yourself a fan of Christmas 
Yes good idea. I’m making you my first sergeant detective general. Our next step is to recruit /r/pavers I already have an in with them.
Really interesting to watch. Had no idea we got Muscala as a result of the JJ trade 
Lol
Interesting defense in the end for that final shot but we still got the W so can't complain.
Prince does something right and then turns around and reverses it.
front office too; collins looks great so far
I really don't care about that game, or the whole season tbh. But many people would wonder if Bazemore is a part of Hawks' bright future (including myself). We get the answer this season and I want to get a yes!
i don't think baze is clutch, but he's certainly improving his game which is a great sign
Saw a red cockaded woodpecker this morning w my coffee, not a hawk but it was an incredible moment and watch!
Is that a thing?

I can’t imagine we will get more bandwagoners next year than we have gotten by going undefeated this season.
The future is bright my friend, apparently this is one of the best drafts on the top end since 09 and we legitamitely have some of the brightest minds in the game to figure it out. 

What I like to do is watch hours of highlights from bagley/Doncic/ayton/Porter and try to figure out who's best for us. In essence we really can't go wrong with any, but just figuring out who would be the best championship foundation type player for us. It's a fun game because you can't lose :D
The Hawks Facebook page is full of DA’s who can’t fathom a rebuild they irk me.
The perfect basketball player doesn’t exi....
will we ever recover from the great swindling of 2016?
Ok nephew, you can pretend to be me for one day or I will tell your daddy Collins to slap your ass tonight.
Will that make him our first mom on the team?
their christmas theme is cool as hell they have falling snow i wish i knew how to that.
I would like to invite everyone here on the Cawks Subreddit over to the much superior /r/pavers. Think of it like a sports sub on mushrooms.
Christmas theme is best theme. 
I'm genuinely enjoying him a lot more than I thought I would
lmao smh
he hasn't commented on reddit in a month lol
Much superior to /r/pacers. Your sub is what I aspire /r/Pavers to become.
our 14 mods combined are like a total of 3,5 active mods lol
I think we're the only team that have our own sub linked on /r/nbacirclejerk
Hahaha, I’ve seen that. 

It links to pavers for us, which made me a proud moddo. 
And I don't think the Celtics have any good reason to send him off.
We picked a good draft to retool while remaining competitive
Yeah he’s on a whole new level of college freshman. I’ve never seen anything like it. I’ve been wanting to trade up into the lottery to get him for a couple weeks, but now I think he’ll go top 5-7.
He looks great but Id still not take him top 5 because of two impressive games

The Miami pick is owned by the sun's and and the Lakers pick is owned by the 6ers, they are both lotto picks so far. If we could figure out a swindle we'll be able to have two picks in the lotto this year

What I'm guessing is if we're going to trade up after our first pick, it's going to be during the day if the draft
That's crazy, tankathon has him as the #6 pick. The disparity in mocks right now is hilarious lol, no one knows where tf anyone's gonna go
Oh the hawks can get back up into the lottery. Just not into the top 10 probably. Unless someone likes Dennis a ton
The good thing is, Dallas, Chicago, Sacramento, Philadelphia, and Boston aren't looking for another point guard, so he probably wouldn't get picked up by them. Our best bets would be to trade up with Charlotte, Orlando, Phoenix, or Memphis, but our other 1st rounders are at 24 and 30 right now, so it would be pretty damn difficult to get it done.
Yee that's what I'm talking about, back into the top 10
We gotta stop wondering about a trade up and start wondering if he will just be our first pick 
I don't think I've seen this guy set a good screen yet.
def the coolest top prospect
ate too many crickets
Taurean Prince has been playing really well for the last month. I hope he can sustain this level. Schroder keeps 20/7 up, and Collins builds his body and gets experience, we have a good prospect coming in the draft. Dare I say in the playoffs in 2/3 years?
nice to see so many play well, but I really wish we could get more production from our guys on the trade block
Good fucking win. Artisan retooling at work
Tbh I think Prince will continue to get better. He really doesn't have any glaring weaknesses,
One left win one right win
He'll get better as he continues to play in the NBA, I think he lacks some athleticism and speed, he also is fairly old for a player in his 2nd year so there is less room to grow than John Collins or an 18yr old 1 and done player. Still I really like where he's at in the 2nd year and he's perfect in Bud's system.
Haha! Yes! Great observation! 

As a frequent visitor of the bird watching subreddit of Atlanta, I for one am fully on board with redesigning the subreddit to something more appropriate. Maybe a landscape picture of our very own Brown Thrasher? Or a couple Red Brested Nuthatches? 

Thank you for your time!

u/EastAtlantaBirds
Retooling while remaining on the nice list 
It's so cute, merry Christmas everyone
Omg it's snowing Retooling While Remaining Competitives, this is DELIGHTFUL
This is amazing
Actually, it is! Please feel free to stay and talk birds!

Here's my birdwatching in the ATL guide from a while back:

I've personally never been in Atlanta so i don't have any first hand experience but I did some research for you:

**Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area—Cochran Shoals Unit**

The Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area (CRNRA) is comprised of a series of protected areas along the Chattahoochee River corridor in the metro Atlanta area. Each unit is maintained by the National Park Service. The Cochran Shoals Unit in Cobb County is used daily by runners and cyclists. It's also a favorite spot for birders and is worth the effort to make a few evasive maneuvers to see the birds.

The Cochran Shoals unit is one of the key Atlanta Audubon sites for spring and fall migration, second only to Kennesaw Mountain. Wetland warblers can be found here. During the height of migration, the species totals here reach the high 60s, with occasional major finds popping up such as Olive-sided Flycatcher and Lincoln's Sparrow in the fall and Connecticut Warbler in the spring. All of Georgia's woodpeckers except the Red-cockaded are found here.

**Kennesaw Mountain National Battlefield Park**

Kennesaw Mountain National Battlefield Park has excellent birding habitat, but is best known as a rich migrant stopover. It is the best Atlanta location for observing fall raptor migration movements. Additionally, the tree lines up and down the paved road to the summit can yield an exciting passerine display, especially during migration. This is one of the best spots east of the Mississippi to see a migrating Cerulean Warbler.

The 3,000-acre Kennesaw National Battlefield Park is the first location in Georgia to be designated by the Audubon Society as an Important Bird Area.

**E. L. Huie Land Application Facility and Newman Wetlands Center These sites**, 

owned and operated by the Clayton County Water Authority, are the metro area's singular best all-around birding area if you are looking for variance in habitat and species. The E. L. Huie facility is one of the best inland locations for shorebirds and waterfowl in the state. There are five ponds inside the facility, and birders can drive the dikes for good views at each pond. The Newman Wetlands Center has trails and boardwalks through wetlands and woodlands and yields a variety of birds, particularly during migration. The self-guided boardwalk tour through the wetlands can yield Prothonotary and Kentucky Warblers, and Louisiana Waterthrush during the breeding season.

**Clyde Shepherd Nature Preserve**

Clyde Shepherd Nature Preserve is a 28-acre property in the Medlock Park neighborhood of Decatur. The preserve opened in 1995 under the management of a neighborhood organization with the goal of preserving natural spaces in the South Peachtree Creek watershed.

The preserve includes wetlands, a four-acre beaver pond, emerging pine groves, wooded uplands, and floodplain bordering South Peachtree Creek. Wildlife habitat includes brush piles, deadfalls, dense brush, and the pond. These diverse habitats are home to beavers, foxes, turtles, snakes, frogs, rabbits, and dozens of species of birds.

Bird highlights include warblers, hawks, woodpeckers, flycatchers, Sedge Wren, Marsh Wren, Hooded Merganser, Blue-winged Teal, Ring-necked Duck, and Great-horned Owl. Wood Ducks nest around the beaver pond and adults and ducklings are regularly seen in spring. Regulars in the summer include Wood Thrush, Orchard Oriole, and Indigo Bunting. In the spring of 2013, this site was a hot spot: a Least Bittern, Wild Turkeys, Yellow-billed and Black-billed Cuckoos, and many warblers, tanagers, and grosbeaks were sighted.

An observation tower funded by a gift from Atlanta Audubon offers a great view of the pond area.
This is clearly a sub about anti-tank weapons. My personal favorite is the TM-46 anti-tank mine, but another good one is the Atlanta Hawks Basketball Club. Pretty impervious to tanks, if you ask me.
I thought this was a sub for road work. Specifically paving roads... to success.
+1 for Kennesaw Mountain. The whole park is amazing.
Or start a fight with them about how tenders are superior to nuggets
We're talking Zaxby's tenders, right? Because those are superior.
Memes aside I think this is a really good move. He's not a star or anything but hopefully next year or two when we start to compete again he can be a good bench contributer.
Great addition to the tank bank
He fits right into our system. This is awesome for our G League team as I know its only our first season having it but Tyler got to practice and play in the same system so when he got the call he knew what to do. 


Hopefully he can pick up a lot of minutes and develop into a good backup bigman
According to the title, baze needs 46 more points
sure but do you like my new christmas theme of the sub?
IT'S BEAUTIFUL
It looks beautiful and puts me in the Christmas spirit! : )
  
However, I was hoping you’d accidentally include some intel on your secured channels in your screenshot...
Better idea, get Luka and Bamba instead
Knowing the Hawks I wouldn be suprised if we traded the Twolves or Rockets pick for Mario Herzojna and then lose him after two years when orlando offers him a huge contract.
Yea, we're more efficient, and every one likes stats nowadays
Such low standards for new flairs nowadays. What'd this guy do? Make I half-court shot? Who can't make those 99% of the time? Personally I think if we're gonna give halftime show contestant flairs, they should be reserved for people who actually did something impressive such as *almost* winning a 2017 KIA Optima, which is worth $12,000 more than what that guy won. You can't argue with the simple fact that the opportunity to win something worth $22,000 is greater than winning $10,000. We should stop praising superfluous halftime show contestants who give nothing of substance to the game of basketball. Focus on what matters. Champion of the March 26, 2017 Hawks-Nets game's KIA Optima Skills Challenge: Leo. Good day.
A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
But a tomato in the bush is worth 7 cicadas on a bench.
Not over anyone in the top 5 but outside that sure.
Hopefully not number 1 but I don’t see why he won’t go top 6 or 7. He’s too consistently dominant. I’ve been vocal on doing what it took to move up into the lottery to get him, but I think he’s just too good too consistently for that to be possible. I fell in love with the idea of him and MPJ because they are best friends apparently.
I am pretty high on Luka right now tbh. He's just too unique and proven to not take at this point unless I see some consistent defensive improvement by ayton. 

Besides the fact that he fits buds system like a glove and his flawless intangibles, he's got pretty remarkable shot mechanics, a true NBA body that is ripe for an NBA muscle training cycle, and Chris Paul-esque vision/BBIQ. I mean we are talking about a complete package here, seriously making game winning plays. And the icing on the cake is he's just 18, and about to go to the coach known for being one of the best (if not the best) development coaches in the league. 

You know bud wouldn't retool for just anyone. And he's like *really* fucking trying to get that top pick. I think this is why he's doing it.
This. Swap baze for doncic + 1 year development from TP, Baptist & Dennis and this is an ok team 
Baze could easily be the 8th or even 7th man to a contending team and I hope that's what ends up happening for us
Mmmm no. The top NCAA schools are definitely more athletic than the Euroleague on average. Not better, but more athletic. Doncic will be amazing regardless.
No that’s when you win every game and still get a top pick 
These hoes ain't loyal
Absolutely masterful tank job done by Schlenkenholzer
Some HIGH Calibre retooling while remaining competitive out there tonight, glad we were able to snag the W against an opponent that is for sure better than their record
Amazing win!
Star Wars spoiler: Hawks defeat the First Order in galactic championship 
The hawks losing is good. Bagley or Doncic or Ashton or Bamba or Sexton or Porter Jr here we come!
Why do you like rollercoasters is a better question 
The retooling process is always interesting. Is John Collins a future Shawn Kemp? Is Dennis Schroder a potential All-Star? Can Bazemore grow to a solid starter, instead of a player that has specific missions? (Lebron stopper type of player) Could Taurean Prince become a solid starter aswell? New faces, new talent and many challenges. I know that most people would answer no to many of these questions, but I beleive in coach Bud and his ability to produce new stars. 
That steak better have been medium rare. 
Word. I watch when Collins is healthy. 
And it is fun to watch the young guys grow. What would have really sucked is if we thought we were going to be amazing and then sucked 
A winning steak such as ours is both rare AND well done
Prediction: Hawks remain undefeated as Babbit continues to solidify himself as the greatest player to ever step on a basketball court 

Hawks 96 Grizz 117 
i actually think that the hawks would be a better team with 4 players and a pile of cash on the court than having miles plumlee out there 
Better prediction: Gasol gets dunked on twice by Collins, immediately requests trade out of embarrassment

Hawks 96, Grizz 117
Get me a a slightly good quality picture of him and I'll try to figure it out
You know we could get some good defensive mismatches with pile of cash
[this](http://a.abcnews.com/images/GMA/171215_gma_shot1_717_4x3_992.jpg) or [this](http://a.abcnews.com/images/Lifestyle/basketball-halfcourt-ht-ml-171215_4x3_992.jpg) second one shows his perfect form 
so whats up? i gave you two excellent pictures 
That second picture would be be hilarious  in red/white/blue as the NBA logo.
please make it happen https://i.imgur.com/t3jTM1S.png https://i.imgur.com/diU8yvM.png u/buteo_jamaicensis made those and i think either would be cool 
Despite me almost breaking all the flairs they're up now thanks to /u/widesheep guiding me through it! 
Still my go-to pick in the draft. Those Doncic/Collins PnR's are goona be great
Seeing how well Teodosic is doing in the league gives me more comfort in the prospective future Luka pick
lol you guys are gettin' Lavine back soon and getting 10th seed
this is EXACTLY the type of hard-hitting journalism I subscribe to /r/AtlantaHawks for SKREEEEEKRRAAAWWWWW
BurgerFi is good af though. 
WITH EVERY ERSAN YOU GET A FREE MALCOLM, NO CHARGE

WE ALSO HAVE FRESH ITALIAN BELINELLIS FOR SALE
What do we have to do to make this whole sub Norman themed? I feel like the world is expecting a certain level of memes from us that needs to be reached. 
What about an AMA?
Norm flair? With a penthouse and $10,000?

Mods?
Arcade Fire announced a shot 15 minutes from my house I'm so happy usually I have to go all the way to freakin' Amsterdam to see such acts.

also goddamn this has not been a very fun to watch week for hawks. 
Damn... Y'all are so undefeated that even your fans are winning...
Great for him!
Is there any way we could just slide Luka Doncic's most recent statline in there in advance?

The good news: John Collins has a great showing on his first game back, Ilyasova had an amazing game.

The good news: Miles Plumlee and Deandre Bembry are keeping this retool on-course.

Oh and a fan hit the half-court 3 to win money!
I'm about it

Also dig the dubs, Philly, magic, and nugs new uni too
love it
Fresh as fuckkk
Yeah but we cut Brussino to sign him to a full deal as soon as his days are up
“Truly, I say to you, among those born of women there has risen no one greater than John the Baptist”
-Jesus 
Jeezy was sooooooooooo much better than 21 savage
It's time to trade Ilyasova. Doubt his stock goes much higher.
Legendary song
Well let's not jynx ourselves, we're in line for the most pingpongballs and a top 4 pick
No of course not dummy. It's just that the NBA thinks we're so good that we deserve the number 1 pick.
[Here they are in 2015 when they said they were a package deal.](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IR6bmBmaObA/maxresdefault.jpg) eating peaches no less. [Two light skinned shooters? Schlenk might be salivating.](https://usathss.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/4638594.jpg?w=640) 
that's a funny way of saying undefeated
I want Luka for the sole reason that good SGs are harder to come by than good Centers
Well, right now we could say that a SG or a C could be a perfect fit to our roster. 

We have Schroder/Bazemore/Prince/Collins/Dedmon (Ilyasova/Collins alternatively). Getting another PG feels unnecessary. Same goes for PF, as Collins shows great potential. There are three positions left but Prince is getting better and better and if keeps that going he will become a great starter in the near future. Bazemore has some specific qualities as a player (there are signs of improvement at the FG% departement) so he can't be a starter for a Playoffs team. Center position is wide open aswell so Ayton/Bamba/Doncic are my guys! 

The lack of a franchise player makes Ayton and Doncic seem more valuable, because both have that profile, or at least they are closer to that, than Bamba is. 

This may change after a couple of trades (Belinelli, Ilyasova, Dedomon) but the situation is clear for me atm. 
I'm all about Porter right now. He has PF height/reach and can really shoot.
You have a good point, but if we get him it wouldnt be the first time we succeeded with an undersized front court. Especially if we move bags to the inside and let JCs shot keep developing

Edit: for what it's worth I'm in the MPJ/Doncic category
No guarantee Collins is worse than Bagley, especially if he develops a shot. Not the best scenario to get a good look at either one of them. It's smart to draft for fit with your core if you have multiple prospects in the same tier at your pick.
He's not even a good passer. Averages more turnovers than assists
Him being back in January is a good sign tbh, he wouldn't be trying to reagrivate his back otherwise
I agree with you about Bagley but if we pick 5th and he’s the BPA we better take him. Drafting for fit is how you get guys like anyhony Bennett 
So does Joel Embiid. He's not Ben Simmons but he can definitely pass. Whatever team that drafts him will probably put him top of the key and let him make decisions. I wish Duke would do that but they're playing just to win and not develop him or show off NBA skills.
Tbh I'm higher on Jackson Jr. and maybe even Bridges than Bagley. I do like Bagley a lot but he has quite a few concerns and I love the top 10 this year.
Big man from MSU. Frame looks like Anthony Davis, all of 6'11" with what looks like a 7'5" wingspan. He can move really really well, handle the ball, shoot, and has great defensive instincts.


Profiles as a stretch 5 with great defense and rim-running.
Great teams win the ugly games. Great job, Hawks. 42-0!
Played great and still got fucked up lmao. So happy Baze is good again though
Ehh it's really about the win column since both teams are way more likely to lose than win. 

Discrepancy in losses doesn't matter too much at this point since we haven't played the same amount of games. 
Nah you were right the first time, it is literally a factory dedicated to giving upvotes
I would cheer for this team if they were playing in a freaking parking lot. I could give two shits about the stadium, I'm excited about the team. Thats what I'm paying for. Yes I understand some people payed more, but they will get a similar experience in Bobby Dodd and there are tons of free perks they threw in as well. I'm disappointed so many people bought tickets to just get a cheap entry into the Stadium for their snapchat stories. If we don't support this team to our best ability your season tickets will become even more worthless.

Lol you have this on standby. I love it

This is sort of in line with your comment but I really really really want a Rasheed Wallace Hawks jersey. I know he only played one game but probably top 3 greatest Hawk ever . Why he isn’t in the rafters is beyond me 
What are you talking about? Our memes are 100% original and funny
The Atlanta Hawks are not a sports team. They are a highly trained combat unit equipped with the most modern artillery and formidable vehicular defense systems in the world. They are the finest collection of tank commanders and troops perhaps in the world. You've got a lot to learn about these parts.
Wow, this guy already knows we have no offense. Welcome aboard!
Who doesn't love Mike Bibby?
Can someone with more knowledge of things explain this move?
Thanks man!
Eh coaching is well and good, but talent wins out and the Thunder drafted three future hall of famers.  If we draft all stars instead of superstars we'll be back on the treadmill in three years.  
they freakin' better
If he's healthy why give him a rehab assignment?
We don't have other talent in that position. Ilyasova, Babbitt and Plumlee are what they are. Ilyasova hopefully nets us a decent return but we don't have any bigs to really showcase. Cavanaugh I guess needs minutes too, but Collins should get priority over everyone. But if this is what's best for his recovery so be it.
Man I love the fight in this team
I just tuned in, but Dennis seems like he has a good attitude and is playing both ends of the floor well
Cavanaugh has really improved..I love watching him play.
COACH BUD CONFIRMED FOR NEXT ROAD TRIPPIN THO :D
The local newspaper,  AJC Hawks Blog has kicked my blogging community of a decade off The Links.  We have no home and are seeking a new spot.  My crew is so talented,  diverse and intelligent.  No trolls there!  I think we will love Reddit! I'm in! Thanks for the WELCOME. smiles
TIED FOR FIRST IN THE LEAGUE YESSSSS
This is literally the best of all time lines.  Fuck the Celtics.  
That’s what I call an acceptable win. 
Well I read that Phillips is about 4 stories high, so on most nights probably about 40-50 feet.
Did anyone ever notice Dennis Schroder looks kind of like a tomato pac man?
True, these are the advanced stats you really need to look for, and not just pay attention to counting stats
You don't always need a top ten PG
True but there’s so much point guard talent in the league now we could replace him with something better easier than anything else. Settling for Dennis is not a part of the process. I’m also not one of those people who thinks we will be anything in the next 2 years. This is a long term rebuild that having an average starter could be getting in the way of. Good is the enemy of great
I'm hoping he'll still be here for when we've had a couple years to develop some younger guys. Having a vet PG in his prime along with some good young players would be exciting. 
I'd trade him for one of those two guys as well but I don't think his value is that high right now. Maybe if paired with our MIN or HOU pick tbh
Sure, but why would they give up what could be a 3-5 pick? To contend with just Booker and Dennis?
That'd be amazing. Those two plus Collins would be the foundation of an elite offense. 
please, don't criticize my great posts™ 
Well, it's not a shitpost at all. The cycle of retooling is a fact. The variable is the period of that cycle. With the right moves it can just take 2 years to become a Playoffs team again. Relying just to a top5 draft pick may extend that period to 4-5 years. 
i mean me photoshopping hawks players heads on to a fruit stall cartoon is most definitely a shitpost. 

We're not aiming to become a playoff team again asap, if we wanted that we could've re-signed Millsap and gotten 43 wins - we're doing this to get a star and become a contender and for that we most definitely need to rely on the draft. No top Free Agents are gonna be coming to Atlanta with Dennis and Bazemore as our best players. 
Ok deal
Lmao
I think he got pissed at Dennis' defense but I just hope Bud manages to keep morale up and benching the only almost-star we have isn't *great* for that.
Lol you really should know better than to bet on ATL sports teams
Umm happy cake day
I love it. 
Wow that ticket buying guide was very helpful by the way, nice job mods
Honestly why do we even have to play these games anymore. Every team we play can't stay competitive enough for 48 minutes and we end up blowing them out. Tonight is just going to be another example of that. Go Hox
Oh god we are actually winning again. I said it earlier this year but I am worried that CMB will coach us to like 25 wins and then we get a shitty pick
This isn't buds first time tanking my friend
Welcome! We might not be the most serious or best Hawks discussion place, but we're definitely a Hawks discussion place. sometimes. 
Thanks,  I'm trying to bring my blogmates over.  The AJC Hawks Blog  are like a family.  Very diverse and spirited, I hope they all show up.  Reddit is cool. 
Dennis is looking good
Came here to say this lol
Ayy lmao roll tide, buddy
Yeah honestly. I’m team doncic>bagley>Anton>MPJ, but our scouting department is incredible. They were eyeing Giannis and Zinger but both went to early (in the case of zinger he stayed an extra year and raised his stock too much). Also looking back we always picked the best player on the board (not counting picks that would’ve been absurd reaches like joking). I’m sure whichever we get will be great. 
I've been doing it for a while now, I started out wanting Porter Jr but after his back id rather have Ayton to pair with collins that would be a monster of a C/PF combo as they're both athletic freaks and once they expand their shot selection its gonna be amazing. 
Just post the Post-Game Thread if there isn't one, but at least add the score. 


Hawks win 117 - 110
I love the kind of wins where the Hawks score more points, yeah!
You are paid very handsomely to do just that
I'm still on a rookie mod contract so I just make slightly more than Bazemore.
Yes, in 10 years after he has won 10 straight MVPs a vintage Cavanaugh^TM jersey will be worth millions, if not billions 
Best investment = full jersey collection of all the Atlanta White Snipers = Magette, Belly, Babbitt, Illyasova, Cavanaugh
I'm swapping all my Litecoin for Cavanaughs right now. 
Come on, y'all. The Stinger is awesome. 

Helped us get through the tank years. (Retooling while being non-competitive)
Some good basketball being played tonight, Jerome!
Yes he is amazing but his laugh is something else 
Tix still available?
Real interesting episode where the guys talk about tanking and the reactions they get from the losing this season as well as injuries.
my favorite hawk of all time the way he handled the ball in the post was just incredible omg omg omg https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPmRzsqL-tw
Might win? All we do is win.
Atlanta Dream coach is hot
I missed the first part of the interview.  Who's the chick?
I love my daddies
Man I'm glad we were able to get a dub before going on this 5 game ~~losing~~ winning streak
HOX WIN
Fffuuuccckkk I wish I was in the A right now
Oh.  Not to reduce a woman and her success to nothing but her looks, but she's very attractive.
only 196 more days guys
Those are two of the best european teams. When you watch a college player dominate, he's playing against people that are not going to even make the pros, don't even think about starting for real madrid. 
Oh, and he is 18. 
the gap in skill from any other league to the nba isn't even quantifiable. Players like Jimmer who aren't even end of the bench talents can become superstars in other leagues. Against superior athletes, the kind you find in the nba, are too lengthy, quick and skilled to be able to beat with up and under moves and ball fakes. Lets be realistic here Doncic is not overly athletic he had middling speed and agility at best compared to the nba he suddenly won't become a better athlete overnight. He is going to have to make his living being a shooter and be able to beat 1v1 coverage, and i don't think he's quick enough or handles the ball well enough to do so, and he won't be able to rely on his IQ with fakes and jabs because defenders know he won't be able to beat them with his first step. Which means they'll be able to play up closer to him and contest his shots even closer and from what I've seen his defense is lack luster as well due to his lethargic lateral speed. Im sure Doncic will be able to find a place in the nba but i don't think warranting our probable top 3 pick for a Nic Batum caliber player is worth it, to me this is another Shelden or Marvin williams or Childress pick in the long line of wasted potential. 
The whole Euroleague vs College comparison is an insult to everyone who plays in Euroleague and mostly made by people who haven't watched a single game in either. Euroleague is built around team defence. Yes, it doesn't have NBA talent but a top Euroleague team can be a 30-win team in the NBA because of their defensive mentality and good team coordination.  
also you realize Batum averages more assist than Doncic no? while not a great indicator at pick a roll prowess it seems as tho his assist numbers would be higher if he was better than Batum albeit Batum has higher quality players 
Kudos to you, Sir. Also good to know google gets it right-ish every now and then...
if he averages 3/4ths of what harden does i will BBQ my old al horford shirt and eat it. Elite vision gets you rubio and parker at best and thats his best skill, come on in no universe will this kid be anything close to harden. He doesnt have the 3 to open up the paint, he's not as quick or shifty as harden and won't be able to blow by defenders with a first step. Harden is a monster because when you press him he can get passed you and if you slack he will bury you with 3s. Doncic is an average 3 point shooter and doesnt have the quickness to beat his man 1v1 which is needed and helps with his pick and role game. 

Darko is a bad example, he didn't enjoy playing basketball, he just wanted to get money (i think zach lowe had a podcast/interview a while ago) and he never really got a chance. 

I am not saying doncic will come to the nba and win a dunk contest, but if he can be an euroleague mvp at 18, there is no reason he can't be good in the nba.
Harden's greatest strength is not his speed lol. His stop-start ability, shooting, and passing are his greatest strengths. Doncic's free throw shooting is the better indicator for his 3pt shot and he's shown the ability to hit NBA range threes when defenders go under screens. And btw it's more like saying Brandon Marshall is a slower Julio.
...you think free throws are indicative for 3 point %... i don't even know if that merits a response.

Harden is great because he's quick and strong enough to penetrate with ease by beating any 1v1 assignment and then dish if help comes or hit the pullup and if you lay off him he will outshoot you like I've said what 3 times now. Doncic shoots dead average from 3 from a shorter distance. this convos over I'm done replying after this. 
prove it. prove theres a strong correlation between 3% and ft%

when you can't id love to hear your excuse 
The best shooters of all time are also excellent ft shooters, theres strong correlation between ft shooting and overall shooting. It boggles how you still cling to you beliefs even though I’m the second guy on the board who said that. 

Again, until you watch a high profile game of EuroLeague do not compare the defenses. Right now you’re clueless.

A quick Google search finds many easy results. If you listened to NBA Draft podcasts or read many articles you'd know this is old news.
Better athletes= better defense lol thats why European teams lose consistently to nba teams bench players when they scrimmage. Of course better shooters shoot better than worse ft shooters lol but theres a weak if any correlation, you don't have to be a good ft shooter and be a good 3 shooter (Bowen, Barton, Harris) just like you can be excellent ft shooter and a poor 3 point shooter (Giannis, Derozan, Embiid, Schroder, Gordon, Griffin). If i cared enough and had the time id run ANOVA to show you theres a weak or no correlation, if someone has more time than me then input the %'s in ANOVA and let me know what u find 
Hey Dennis glad to have you on the sub with us. Friendly heads up, you should really be using the German flair
Daddy is more like oči, ati, atek in Slovenian. Oče has a much more serious tone to it, like father or dad in english. :)
Awesome dude thanks for the heads up! (:
I think he meant Tavares not Doncic, Tavares was brought to Real because two of their best bigs are injured.
We have a lot of big men hurt, and we just cut a healthy one?
hello hawks friends what were your favourite albums of the year?

 [here's my list.](https://i.imgur.com/1vVfIx0.jpg)

edit: someone is going through my comments and downvoting them all very cool.
I posted this in the Braves sub too, but if anyone is interested, the Atlanta Braves are hiring a Major League Advance Scout Trainee.

https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=5805d57999d4655c&l=atlanta,+GA&tk=1c0ujc2ut0g4h1k5&from=web


Would be a dream opportunity for me if it were the Hawks. Oh well. I'm sure there are some Braves fans here - this was only posted 30 minutes ago so you are good to go!
Alright, so are we liking Ayton or Bagley more right now?
Flower boy was my favorite of the year by far. It’s my favorite hip hop album ever
Don't necessarily have to trade Dennis, Doncic is pretty big so he'll probably play at the 2 or 3 in the NBA. He's a great playmaker though but taking that responsibility away from Dennis could only be good - I think they can be pretty good next to each other and make up for each others weaker sides

Agreed on Bembry I love him so much. 
forgot it’s summer in austria right now. 
Okay its actually snowing now here 
Free volt color t shirt is my guess.
We tried to figure that out all last season. Basically just different clips on the jumbotron lol. Marketing stunt
That’s what I was thinking. Hopefully it’s safe enough for me to take my gf 
All is see is 24 straight wins.
Really impressive CGI at the end of the game there. 82-0 still alive 
is your toe ok
I have to wonder: Are we intentionally winning on purpose?
OK but what if I told you it's retractable on overcast days
man we blow. still love them though! favorite team in atlanta. 
Come on now Hawks, the Bulls are winning, let's just close this one out

*EDIT: Dammit, the Bulls are so clutch
Great second quarter
Did we say we cut him because he isn't good enough - maybe he just didn't fit Coach Bud?

Also we didn't re-sign Calderon and he's starting for the Cavs - but it's fairly easy to look good when your playing with KD or LeBron -try that playing next to Miles Plumlee. 
Nice
Bill Walton called him the best center since Shaq
He was good but not flat out dominant like he had been. But he showed some good stuff
There’s no way we could trade back up that high. These top 5 picks are incredibly valuable and we would have to mortgage multiple drafts worth of picks to get one 
Knock on wood we are top 5 we have 
Minisotas and Houston’s picks. 
I’m sure we will be top 5 with out pick. I’m gonna guess 1-4, 19-25, 26-30
There’s been trade value charts for picks. The charts are pretty accurate for the NFL draft, but you never know with the NBA because the level of the draft varies so much from draft to draft. I’ve looked at them though and the consensus is, if we got the picks as they were today, we could trade the Timberwolves and rockets pick to move up to 13 at the highest. 
Good looks
<.1% chance we don't win? This is Atlanta sports. We doomed.
Nice touch on the bottom there ahahah 
I'd be so happy. 

ESPN's latest had us drafting MPJ at #4
[Also here he is blocking our very own charge daddy almost two years ago](https://streamable.com/ptsd3) (so at 17 years old)
Honestly any of them would make me happy, but I think Luka would fit the best with us. Bud loves running two ball handler lineups, Luka would make an excellent secondary ball handler. Not to mention we need a deadeye shooter in buds system, Luka can easily be that. He's been shooting an NBA 3 since he was 16. Not to mention the other amazing intangibles. MPJ I would also be down with if his medicals check out

With my dying breath i will scream- **AYTON BAGLEY AND MPJ ARE BETTER PICKS AND WILL BE BETTER PLAYERS THAN DONCIC**
You guys are gonna drop out of the top 5 because you’ve been winning too much
I agree. Even if one or both bust, it's worth the risk. Doncic at his peak will be a solid, fringe all-star at best. Not exactly the type of player you tank for.
Hey now, we can take away the Subreddit MVP honor as easily as we gave it.
You definitely have a point there but if we keep Dennis who is very quick it could even out between them. His range seems to pretty good, and some time at Hawks University I'm sure a lot of concerns about his game will be repaired.
Doncic putting up GOAT numbers for an 18yo in Euroleague.. Also looks like the best player there.. Meanwhile Porzingis, Jokic, Saric, Dragic, Dirk and the rest look like complete scrubs over there.. Dude will be a superstar FOR SURE
Doncic at his peak could be a better Manu Ginobli Where did you pull this fringe all star nonsense from
I won’t be intimidated by the likes of you. I’m burning this sub to the ground and exposing the Hawkspiracy to the world. If you take my flair, you’ll just make me a martyr for other members of the resistance. So go ahead and try! I will gladly die in the name of my lifelong battle against your group of racist(Germans mostly), Yugioh playin, conspiracy havin, secured channel usin bastards!
Despite his injury, really feel like he has been the most exciting player on this team, and I'm excited to see what he can do post-injury.
no one has overlooked him, even a BlindeGroßmutterohneBeine can see that he's good
Good attempt, but prepositions (ohne) usually don't go in compound words. 
We comin for your 33 straight win streak lakers and we also gonna blow your 73-9 regular season win record warriors 
Love it.
Nice try ATF
Um the broadcast isn’t supposed to be unbiased. It’s 100% hawks leaning as it should be. Bob and Nique are the best
This is AMAZING!
I am assuming all those people went to get drinks during a timeout because I know there aren’t that many empty seats for the undefeated best team
in the league!
they heard the crickets, and were like "damn I bet that would be good in a taco"
[nah this is right ](https://m.imgur.com/gF6UA9t) 
Nets please. Bulls are too powerful and we need your help
i promise our guys will actually play to win this time, and not dick around and ruin your chances at that juicy 1st pick
Hawks v net's is back baby. It's good again. Awoouu (wolf Howl)
That Harry the Hawk skit was golden.
lmao bumlee puttin in work
Bob and Niq always know how to stay positive
I fully expect an L tonight. More Nets fans in Atlanta than Hawks fans
We don't even have Nets fans in Brooklyn lmao, what makes you say that
HAKWS ARE UNDEFEATED!

BEST TEAM EVER!
You wouldn't happen to be German would you?

Also, favorite go-to movie?
One of the sexiest people in Atlanta right here
just remember, it wouldn't be the first time the team has paid for a wedding
Interested.  PM'ing you.
Damn what a diamond in the rough, we always play the Celtics incredibly well. I guess I should thank this guy. I also didn't know bud has degrees in philosophy, politics, and economics. This was a great read
He gave some excellent tips and advice at the coaches clinic last a few months ago. Pretty cool dude
He's definitely making more creative passes and manipulating the defense with his handle better this year.
Sure, he still doesn't have outstanding vision but his skill level has definitely increased.
Can we stop winning please? Bulls are easily gonna get the number 1 pick. 
Although unironically winning isn't great, good game - Career high for Bembry!
Tbh we legitamitely had the top 2 best NBA players on the court today, kinda unavoidable but to win it. Cavs might actually have a top 5 pick this year tho, and I am not a fan of when the Cavs get to the lotto recently. Strange things happen
3 more wins until we make history!
I can't believe I can tell my kids one day I saw the greatest player in nba history play.
Don't forget about Dallas. They're hot garbage too. 
They will get Lavine back at some point who is better than most players on the Hawks.
True. 
I've never seen that before. Interesting to see how the net moves
are you sure?
I'm expecting us to come out with a chip on our shoulder tonight, this win might not be as easy as the others
Bellinelli? More like Ball-in-and-outelli.

lol we're gonna unironically win this
i genuinely love plumlee now
Isaiah Taylor is the best IT in the league
Isaiah Taylor was a good pickup 
Bembry's good too
Bulls are getting Lavine back soon and Mavs just won as well, we'll be  fine.
It wasn't announced yet that he would be starting when I made the thread I don't think anyone posts more about plumdog than me
did you consult the sharecare reps to make sure it was okay?
Good luck with that, your team might be shit, but ours is diarrhea. The 1st pick is ours 
we sure do run a tight ship here don't we :)
Can't wait until 2018 when Overwatch League announce the Atlanta Tanks as their first expansion team.
Are you saying Dennis eats his own cum
Jokes aside we got the best halftime artists
I watched Gucci propose. You don't get that anywhere else.  Plus the halftime show was pretty much a Gucci concert. 
lmao the way he didn't want to kneel still gets me every time
We need more Plumlees.
Lmao! This has got to be the funniest sub in the nba
i'm sure his time with the warriors will help him fit right in to our championship culture.
I for one am glad he did.

Would we be undefeated this season if we weren’t remaining competitive??
honestly we probably would with the way our dads are playing rn
LOL this is the first time I've heard that
Its because our granddad's love us
It’s okay, we need him to rest up before the Finals
Eh, him and Deddy need to give the other bigs a chance to bask in the glory of win streak 
I’m worried about our win streak though!
Nah Plumlee is back we should be good
That whole game I was imagining how much better his stats would be if we had literally one more player that could score consistently or create their own shots. The cavs just threw Lebron on him and that’s all it took to stop our offense. 
That's true, Lebron did seem kinda tryhard
A memer arrives precisely when he means to
/r/nba is gay
The Cavs we're easier to beat than they were the first time we beat them this year! EZ wins EZ lyfe boiz
yea i think we can get a decent-to-good haul for those players. altho honestly id keep dedmon. he's a good piece to have around
Claimed - thx! :)
This meme is like an over-sized onion: too many layers to count.
Lol now I see he did it on r/nba first.
Lol that’s a much different place 
I honestly don't see any feasible was for us to get another top 5 pick, at least not at this point in time. But it's a viable question

the Cavs arent going to want to trade their pick for any of our guys, they want to win now or have someone to build on after LeBron leaves. The Mavs are too smart to trade out of this draft. The bulls are too devoid of talent to want anyone we have. We would have to wait to see who the real 5th team at the bottom is this year, there looks like there's gonna be some competition.

It's not crazy to think we might be able to trade Phoenix if they're at the bottom too, but the talent at the top this year is so good that they might not even want to give it up. 

I think if we're really trying to get another one of these talents we would need to trade some of our future firsts (never gonna happen),  we trick a third team in on the deal (highly unlikely but possible), or we pull some draft night ropeadope and some how swindle a team into taking our picks this year to move up. 

The simple fact is we just don't have the  assets to get two picks in the top 5 without risking our future
Why are those four great players all standing around a snake
Cool shirt 
Hey I have two available if you still need them, 20 each
Damn that's really nice.

Damn, they have isolation tanks?  Sweet
I've personally never been in Atlanta so i don't have any first hand experience but I did some research for you:

**Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area—Cochran Shoals Unit**

The Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area (CRNRA) is comprised of a series of protected areas along the Chattahoochee River corridor in the metro Atlanta area. Each unit is maintained by the National Park Service. The Cochran Shoals Unit in Cobb County is used daily by runners and cyclists. It's also a favorite spot for birders and is worth the effort to make a few evasive maneuvers to see the birds.
 
The Cochran Shoals unit is one of the key Atlanta Audubon sites for spring and fall migration, second only to Kennesaw Mountain. Wetland warblers can be found here. During the height of migration, the species totals here reach the high 60s, with occasional major finds popping up such as Olive-sided Flycatcher and Lincoln's Sparrow in the fall and Connecticut Warbler in the spring. All of Georgia's woodpeckers except the Red-cockaded are found here.

**Kennesaw Mountain National Battlefield Park**

Kennesaw Mountain National Battlefield Park has excellent birding habitat, but is best known as a rich migrant stopover. It is the best Atlanta location for observing fall raptor migration movements. Additionally, the tree lines up and down the paved road to the summit can yield an exciting passerine display, especially during migration. This is one of the best spots east of the Mississippi to see a migrating Cerulean Warbler.
 
The 3,000-acre Kennesaw National Battlefield Park is the first location in Georgia to be designated by the Audubon Society as an Important Bird Area.


**E. L. Huie Land Application Facility and Newman Wetlands Center**
These sites, owned and operated by the Clayton County Water Authority, are the metro area's singular best all-around birding area if you are looking for variance in habitat and species. The E. L. Huie facility is one of the best inland locations for shorebirds and waterfowl in the state. There are five ponds inside the facility, and birders can drive the dikes for good views at each pond. The Newman Wetlands Center has trails and boardwalks through wetlands and woodlands and yields a variety of birds, particularly during migration. The self-guided boardwalk tour through the wetlands can yield Prothonotary and Kentucky Warblers, and Louisiana Waterthrush during the breeding season.

**Clyde Shepherd Nature Preserve**

Clyde Shepherd Nature Preserve is a 28-acre property in the Medlock Park neighborhood of Decatur. The preserve opened in 1995 under the management of a neighborhood organization with the goal of preserving natural spaces in the South Peachtree Creek watershed.
 
The preserve includes wetlands, a four-acre beaver pond, emerging pine groves, wooded uplands, and floodplain bordering South Peachtree Creek. Wildlife habitat includes brush piles, deadfalls, dense brush, and the pond. These diverse habitats are home to beavers, foxes, turtles, snakes, frogs, rabbits, and dozens of species of birds.
 
Bird highlights include warblers, hawks, woodpeckers, flycatchers, Sedge Wren, Marsh Wren, Hooded Merganser, Blue-winged Teal, Ring-necked Duck, and Great-horned Owl. Wood Ducks nest around the beaver pond and adults and ducklings are regularly seen in spring. Regulars in the summer include Wood Thrush, Orchard Oriole, and Indigo Bunting. In the spring of 2013, this site was a hot spot: a Least Bittern, Wild Turkeys, Yellow-billed and Black-billed Cuckoos, and many warblers, tanagers, and grosbeaks were sighted.
 
An observation tower funded by a gift from Atlanta Audubon offers a great view of the pond area.



Kennesaw mountain is the only correct answer here, its absolutely gorgeous at any time of year and I'm sure there are a plethora of birds to watch lol. 
None of there places are actually in Atlanta. Most are outside the perimeter. I recommend Hartsfield Jackson. The metal birds are the best birds in the perimeter. 
I honestly just picked a team pretty much at random, i liked the logo I think.


This Collins kid is pretty good. 
I LOVE YOU JC
I love Collins' motor 
John Collins just did that right in front of Lebron
It's okay I miss Dad too
S U CC YO UU?? NO! S U CC M EE :D
Yeah he talked about it before when the report came out. I'm sure there might have been one guy on the team who might have been relieved but I don't believe they voted him as best team mate as a joke.
Of course he would say that, you think he's gonna talk shit about Shoulders and risk losing his girl to the best pussy eater in the league? come on guys.
It's fun to see a guy like him play and he has his moments but in complete honesty he's not an NBA level player on a team better than us. Like he's a third-string player on a tanking team and that's pretty much the best it's gonna be for him I think. I like having him on the team though and he seems like a great guy by all accounts. 
[
Here he is scoring his first three and that was a pretty nice moment.](https://streamable.com/eqktv)
I swear coach bud signs a token white guy every year because he wants to fulfill their dreams since he wasnt able to make the league himself lol, i bet coach bud sees himself in magette
Pero Antic has got to be another example of this lol
Good thing we have our winning streak to keep us warm at night...
Good you guys don’t deserve him
At least he won't be helping us win games any time soon...
That’s an ideal scenario. I mean, a team like Chicago needs a center more than a guard. There’s still the possibility guys like Lavine and Dunn can get better while improving the center position and replacing Lopez. 
All I want in life is Marvin Bagley in a nice, comfy Hawks uniform out their on the court. Please, God, if you're up there, deliver him to us.
1) Ayton 2)Bruce Brown 3)Allen

Id like a safer pick before allen so prolly Brown or Trier. But hopefully Minnesota shits the bed and we get the 15th pick. Ayton and Collins would set the future nicely as Ayton gives the ability to defend the rim and stretch the floor assuming his 3's become a lil more viable. As Collins develops he's only going to get better defensively and stop fouling and start moving his feet and stop hand checking.

We could always package a Dennis and a pick (the latest 1st, prolly Houstons) for another crack in the lottery and try to pick up Sexton or maybe Porter jr/Knox depending on who's left. I don't think we would be able to trade up high enough to pick someone like Doncic if we use our first on Ayton. 
Grayson Allen would be a sweet pick bc of how athletic he is and if he gets his shot consistent. He's been at Duke with coach k for 4 years so that's also a huge plus and probably an easy transition into buds system
Are you suggesting a lineup with Doncic the guard playing power forward? Bold
Oh, I messed up, that doesnt make any sense. I feel Bud could still want to draft Doncic though and pOsItIoNlEsS bAsKeTbAlL amirite.

more like
Dënnïs/Doncic/Baze gaze/TP/Collins

Thats a good point. We have had injuries. Its a reach probably just because its too early in the season. But I feel like at the beginning of the season, Collins was replacing Dedmon, but now they are more likely to play together. We are also starting to get an idea of where we are going to fall in the draft. I think it could be an experiment for drafting a C and playing him alongside Collins.
Probably eventually, but I think Baze would start over the rookie for most of the year. I would say Doncic is probably good enough to start right away and I don't see who else would take Baze's spot.
Tbh I'm really liking what I'm seeing from dedmon right now, I would be okay with taking a center later and redshirting him under dedmon until he comes into his own or packaging picks and trading up for the next best one

So next year it would look something like Schrö, Luka, TP, JC, and Dedmon
He really is. if you look at his DRPM -3.30 as of right now. That's the 87th best PG in the league at defense, yikes. Even the eye test proves it as well, he is continuously lost when defending off ball. it really is frustrating
Man I'm so glad we got grant hill as part of the ownership. Dude just gets it. Not alot of baze or moose but damn this was a good'n, ton of good QnAs
If I didn't know better I'd think LeBron might be scared of us. Don't blame him though, I mean when you're about to play literally the greatest team to ever bounce a ball on hardwood you'd try anything to avoid the potential embarrassment/baptisms
good
>garbage time

You'll have to be more specific.
Well we weren't happy about it either.
Guess what, I'm gonna do the times in my own timezone from now on as well. 
http://store.nba.com/Atlanta_Hawks_Jerseys but it's funny thow how the browser tab says "Nike Jerseys" and the pics show the adidas jerseys.
I honestly think Bud is doing a great job coaching this year. He understands the situation that we're in and he's trying to involve just about everyone.
Schlenk probably did a good job of selling the prospects this year too

I bet it went something like "pop had the admiral and oldman Riverwalk, who have you had like that?" 
Yeah this part is underrated, we picked 19th and came away with John Collins, imagine we drafted just a run of the mill 19th pick who would be spending time in the G-League? That wouldn't be pretty. 
Watch doncic go to work on his highlights he is a physical SG that we need on our team . He would drive it to the hoop and throw it up to John so nicely 
I think an Ayton/Collins front court would be scary. But lately, I've been high on Bagley, with like you said, he's more versatile than Ayton, and having Marvin with Collins, you can really play around with Collins sometimes playing the PF or the C on some days. 

I honestly don't know which is best, my mind changes every day. 
if we are basing this off of our current roster, i think a big center like ayton or bamba fit best. although watching the play making of doncic really makes me want him on the team 
Ayton/Bagley + Sexton? That’s the ideal scenario. Also, I think we can keep Taurean if we’re giving up Dennis and both other picks. 
Yeah, Sexton is looking like the best PG for the 2018 draft. To have him and any of the top 4 would be surreal. I think it could happen, and I feel Phoenix would be the perfect team to trade Dennis for another possible top 10 pick. Dennis would be a huge upgrade over Mike James, and Phoenix already has a lot of talent that's been untapped. They're loaded in the frontcourt position and to insert Dennis into their team could help out their growth.

I'm saying both picks just make sure it's more than enough, but considering throwing Dennis into the mix is already more than enough, wouldn't be surprised if both picks aren't involved. 
Did someone say Rudy Gay?
many
I'm fascinated, retooling so fine that I masturbated
Tank to the top, and the pick came w a blunt in it
Bagley looks real. True centers won’t be able stick with him and with his current development progression  I believe in him to at some point be fully able to take advantage of smaller defenders in the NBA. We don’t need to be scared of Duke players busting either. Tatum looks good and I’m not sure Bagley has enough shortcomings to be worries at all. 30 and 15 in the no. 7 team in the nation, he’s my now at the top of the wish list for me.
Yeah I think having him at center and Collins at 4 would be awesome, I feel like they would complement each other. Plus a 6'11 dude w handles and a 3 point shot that drops 30/15 is titeeee
Ayton too tho, MPJ could also legitimately end up the best player from this class as well
Al was a great defender though and so was Millsap.
They weren't great defenders right off the bat, they had to be taught alot of what they knew. We can teach Bag and JC the same
Sexton is point guard Kobe. If he were shooting guard sized he’d go #1 easily
They were great defenders for Bud right off the bat
Sure, after a couple years in the league before bud got his hands on them
Slice it up with some fresh mozzarella!
Intentional or not, the lack of line breaks is a nice touch.
Fun fact: linebreaks weren't introduced to HTML until 2002. 
I just realized I'm gay
How many shitposts deep will this go
Good quality question. I personally don't, but I can see the value in asking.
Pretty sure farmers grew tomatoes with the Hawks logo in mind
This kid dropped 40 on a top 15 team as a true freshman. And 23 of it came in 10 minutes playing 3 against 5! THREE AGAINST FIVE!!! And he still got buckets and almost brought them back. Like they were behind the entire game and he almost singlehandedly had a comeback. That’s special. Like special special. [he looked Penny Hardaway in the eyes as a high schooler, told him his son was trash, and dropped 33 on him.](http://www.totalprosports.com/2016/12/26/high-school-b-ball-player-looks-penny-hardaway-in-the-eyes-tells-him-his-son-is-trash-video/). True mamba mentality. And he’s from Atlanta!

Collin & Collins anyone?
I wouldn't put him in my top 3 yet but I could be okay with a scenario where we trade Dennis for a top 10 pick and get him with that I think.
Would love this guy with maybe Doncic. Can someone remind me of the number of picks we have rn?
I’d pull the trigger in a heartbeat. Sexton is dropping 30 pretty consistently, so it may be moving up to right outside the top 5
Ours, the T-Wolves if they make the playoffs, and the rockets pick if it’s not in the top 3. None that could get him and Doncic
Would be an amazing haul for sure. I'd be more excited for the future of the Hawks than I've ever been if this happened honestly.
When the wolves made the playoffs say like 8th seed what would be the ideal number pick? 
Actually you said 5th seed but good to job 
Damn I was hoping It’d be top 10 lol but that’s not bad tho we could prolly get kevin Knox 
Oh, I know. I precisely said rebuild, not tank. 
oh ok thank u breedofepicness
i hate that people on /r/nba think the meme is that we count a loss as a win because of the draft lottery. just straight up pretending we win everything is a much funnier concept to me.


Also if that's what it was, wouldn't we then have to count the wins as losses?
Is this a sarcastic post? We're first in the east and we won last night...not sure why we have to get through it but ok
Successfully retooled while remained uncompetitive
Well there’s one good thing that will come out of the hawks being complete ass. They will get a really good draft pick.
Easy win for the Hawks as we blow out the Raptors.
I love him, but he is basically Brock Osweiler.
Harsh but fair
I wish he was what moose was when the team was actually good. Just fun on the bench that gets a few minutes and is decent 
Still available?
Never knew about this site. That's awesome. Thanks. 
Michael Porter will be a good consolation prize :)
this exact scenario will happen. we will get shafted, watch.
Idk nets looking like they could be a fringe playoff team in the east so I’m not worried about the cavs, however the nba loves the Lakers and the West is so stacked Lakers might very easily end up with a top pick again and straight to the Celtics. 
Pretty sure the Bulls are in last unless this is just some simulation 
Yeah I agree with you on the Nets and I don't think the Lakers are a bottom 5 team but it's the Celtics so you know they'll get lucky somehow
Im pretty sure the Bulls are trying to get Luka or Ayton at thispoint. Bagley is off the table since Lauri is the guy for Chicago, Porter is injured, so I see those guys going top 2. 
No he doesn't... He's just getting more minutes
No one's talking about the Mavs. And the Bulls are a huge market team like the Lakers, people are always gonna be talking about those. 
I agree with you on Bulls, but Mavs get a fair share of exposure.
"Hey, come on..." 

I love it
I played in the top golf bay next to THJ back in the day, miss that guy. He had a great swing. 
I hope we can create some distance between ourselves and the Mavs/Bulls/Kings so I can just enjoy these wins without feeling a little tinge of anxiety that we might be hurting our draft odds every time we win
GG coming from a Knicks fan

Guess we needed more Turkey cuz Kanter who ate too much Turkey was out..

Idk why you guys have so many fair weather fans, just not showing up to the games.. Schroder is gonna be a stud you guys should be excited.
# Coach Bud Basketball:  WIN
Make sure to inform him about how we swindled Teague
That's awesome
So backhanded lol. Gg 
Yea it was back when he was riding the bench and even playing d league. Was with his GF and family. Seemed like a good dude. 
I like how Dadman still gets called by last name but Hardaway gets called Timmy.

Hawks legend Jarrett Jack

Dadman and Baptist have Blake Griffin DeAndre Jordan levels of big man chemistry. Dedmon is so good at setting up John
Good vision by magette
Tonight we tie the franchise win streak record with a win!

________

We will also tie if we remain competitive.
THJ has always been pretty streaky and giving him 17 mil per year would've felt like another Bazemore signing if it didn't pan out. Happy for him, but I think FO made the right move. He's still my daddy though.
It's pretty cool, I'm gonna start doing it.
The real reason is probably because he’s an old rookie who just got called up from the d league and it’s fun that he’s getting minutes 
lmao i came here to ask about that dude too
This man's got it right!
He moves so fluently for a guy his size. He’s quickly replacing daddy doncic as my favorite in the draft. 
Would u be ok getting ayton and Colin Sexton instead?
Then I will love them all the same 
Let's try to keep it to when they have really exceptional games - unless we really meme it up and turn the entire sub in to a college/euroball sub.
If we get another top 10 pick I'd be good with Sexton but if it's top 5 it's gotta be one of Bagley, Ayton, Doncic, Porter or Bamba
3 wins and 15 wins. Not too shabby
Mods here, OlafdePolaf is the best user here by a mile and also the image clearly says we're 18-0 maybe your monitor or phone is displaying it wrong. 
I am thankful for the best mods in the NBA.
I am tankful to be ~~paid by Sharecare~~ apart of this great subreddit.
Yeah! Kooreb is a sham, and is nothing like the great Koorob.
That’s another tool in our retoolbox right there. 
As a Knicks fan I just want to say THANK YOU. He’s worth the contract and maybe even more. Maybe we can drop off Ntilikina and sign him to a max like last time :)
Nothing brings more pleasure to my life than watching salty Knicks fans walking out of Philips 
Great game by THJ, kid's going to be an All-Star for us for sure
Jokes aside, tonight was great. Hawks lose, Celtics lose, Mavericks win. One step closer to Daddy Doncic
How could you lose count.  Our win streak is at 18.  A win Friday ties the franchise win streak record!!!
Andre Iguodala. Decent scorer, can make some plays, great defender and rebounder. 
Yeah, I also get DMC vibes from him, which is fine. that's a solid player to have on a contending team
Yup. Ideal to come off the bench on a contender. At least in the super team era 
some powerful math right here
I'm so happy we have this podcast now it really makes you connect with the team more.
I'd love it if 499 caught on as Baze's call-sign/nickname type of deal. From 499 in the league to #1 in our hearts.

Wish someone would have asked about the locker room atmosphere considering the season
You are most welcome. Beep boop.
Well it's a good thing we aren't tanking then huh
Can't make it tonight. Message me if you want my daddy-viewing passes in Section 312 (fo free). 

Edit: Claimed.
Collins with his first NBA start. They grow up so fast :,)
Blake Griffin vs Better Blake Griffin (JTB) in an all out slugfest 
I don’t mean to jinx it, but if we win tonight we are 1 game from tying the franchise win streak record!
In all my years as a Hawk fan, I have never been so excited about a rookie until now
If we unironically win this it would on the one hand be fun to be reason that another team is sent into complete desperation and maybe fires their coach but on the other hand with MPJ maybe ruined for this draft we need every L we can get.
Turn around and wave to section 217 at the 10 minute mark in the first quarter...further instructions to follow
Just go for the in-arena music. We have not only the best record in the NBA, but also the best DJ and organist. Sir Foster is a legend. 
I'm fine if we draft the one and only D Pick himself. 
His shot looks smooth right here.
Lol idk why people stay dissing the hawks 
Not like he would be available at 30 anyway
He'll still be in the top 5 imo, maybe this will be a blessing in disguise for us if we get basketball-reasons'd or we budball out of the top 4. We'll be able to flex some of those Emory muscles

It's only a 5 month return time so he'll have plenty of time to prepare and rehabilitate and work out for us if we're trying to draft him
Goddamit I wanted him the most. Even if we drop to 4, there's no way we take him, right? 

Doncic has the highest floor but the lowest ceiling. Good thing Bud isn't the GM anymore bcuz he would pick him without thinking. I'm pretty sure he's gonna average 17/6/6 (think Batum) on good efficiency in his prime but do you really want to draft a guy like that? Unless he shoots somewhat like Steph, he's not gonna be the primary guy breaking down the best defenders come playoffs. He's gonna be a top 3 slowest non-center player in the league and be very switchable. With a pick that high you go boom or bust, if it's a bust guess what you get to draft high again. Repeat until you get a star and don't get mired in mediocrity.

Bagley is giving me Josh Smith/Michael Beasley vibes. If we don't develop him perfectly immediately I feel like he's gonna learn shitty habits and never recover. Kenny Atkinson is gone and idk how Bud is gonna do.

I feel like Ayton is the best play, but then again I want a wing guy because that position is so scarce right now, with pretty much all the best young players being centers. Don't even think about Bridges, Sexton or some other shit like that. Haven't seen Bamba play yet. Fuck this injury man. 
He is still my top choice. Followed by ayton 
best case scenario his draft stocks takes a dramatic hit and we get him with the twolves pick. 
Okay he will probably go top 5, but what if he doesn’t? What could we get for Dennis and our other two picks? Or even the cavs pick next year. 
YEah but we have the rockets pick which might be top 3
LOL Zion is not good at all. Dude can't do anything besides dunk.
The league is pretty point guard rich right now, so I guess you’re right. The Suns, Pacers, and maybe magic come to mind. The magic are the only ones who shouldn’t run to the podium if MPJ was available to them outside the top 5. They have Gordon and just drafted Isaacs. Picking up a young, proven scorer at PG could be the better option for them given fit.
Imagine if we turn the Hawks best player away because if subreddit meme. That would be the GOAT shitpost
Oh I’m very aware. You could even say I’m woke to the racist ideology propagated by /r/AtlantaHawks. It just adds to the conspiracy.
It is not based in racism but we had to take measures to run an efficient subreddit. By identifying Germans with the special flair we know when they 'can't post because the AMA was probably at some time at midnight in Germany, hence I wouldn't be up to ask the question.'
As a German-American I can tell you that we are quite happy with the comprises made by the mods of this subreddit.

I do not fear, at all, that they might use their categorical identification of Germans for anything malicious.  The self-identification is voluntary and simply makes things easier for Germans.

However, some other Germans do call me Onkel Tommen.
He has the flair, we're all good. 
Nice sting operation there guys, well done. Let's sprinkle some crack around and someone give that corpse a gun.

I've flaired appropriately to be classified during Coach Bud's Basketball and Internment Summer Camp.
It's Danish my love
A tanking team vs a team who is re-tooling while remaining competitive. Sure to be a good one.


Clips fan here too. Love how funny this sub is. It's why I stay subscribed. Y'all my Eastern Conference fam
Yeah I'm not sure what isn't allowed here. It's pretty great
And yes I know they're talking about the Seahawks. That doesn't fit the narrative so let me shitpost in peace thank you
I got the joke, great post
The shitposts are strong here

I like it
i just LOLd so hard that video was fuckin perfect
Did the Hawks IG do this or did OP?  Either way, brilliant.
LOL, this is something i'd expect to see on here
We've just played two of the best defensive teams in the league and Collins was matched up with Horford and Aldridge, and he's put up 16 and 21 in those games. He's gonna be great. 
Big 3 looked fantastic tonight! I need JTB playing 36 minutes and take 20 shots every night if he's going to give 21/9 like this

Dennis had a rough start but kept grinding until he strung together a nice box score.

And of course our MVP Kent got us that much closer to our 2019 ROTY.

Not even being sarcastic, Kent is exactly the kind of player we need right now, and it's fun to watch him do his thing
man what a win for the hawks tonight
I was watching the falcons. What Johnny Boy we good of his stats?
Light skin Wake Forest PF that lived in the Virgin Islands who's coached by someone from the Spurs coaching tree.


That's about it though
We're first place boysss!
Seeing as I was just now added to a new one I myself don't even know how deep the secured channels go to be honest.
Confirmed that Pop has a picture of Bud Jr in his locker but someone really ought to tell him that guy's name is Josh Magette and that he is only a Hawk because his dad is Mike Budenholzer
FREE BEMBRY/PIERRE/THE FRO
yeah ur right, I just remembered hearing his name on the radio when I was driving home, figured he played more than 1 minute 
http://news.sportslogos.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/ATL_city2.png

Edit: Keep in mind that the article says "These mockups are compiled from a general description of the uniform where the only confirmed design detail is the primary colour of the uniform and (for some of the uniforms) the wordmark / logo to be placed on it."
Hot damn. Glad I waited to get a Collins jersey. Gonna need to cop this one 
I love this thing. I've always loved the volt green though.
That was a really good in depth article. Hopefully you can get paid to write full time 
Lol this is what i've been telling people at school that say I should stop supporting the team
Love the article! I️ wouldn’t call Dennis, TP, and Collins stars yet but they are all good players. Dennis having a chance to be considered a star soon. I️ feel this team is two elite players away from being a title contender. The combo of 10 draft picks and all the cap space a team could need gives Hawks just that opportunity. Hopefully we can get as lucky as the warriors! 
Great article man, enjoyed reading it!
Good article Baby Bjas, enjoyed reading it 
I've read this in full twice and each time ive loved the way you write. excellent write up, and I too have thought the same thing, that the hawks are a few steps away from being contenders. Cheers friendo:)
I've been saying this to everyone. I really think the Hawks can be special in a couple years. I don't think that tanking is always going to lead to success; and frankly, I think it's a little overrated. I mean look at Philly, Pheonix, and Orlando: they've been tanking forever and they've had hardly any success in the past decade. It's clear that while you need talent, you need to be able to develop that talent to its full potential. 


That's why I'm excited for the Hawks. I don't think they have the most talented young roster, but the organization knows how to develop them from good players to great. There's a reason that many former Hawks players don't always perform the same when they leave to different teams (Korver, Carroll, arguably Horford)
Lol I know this isnt likely but do you guys think we could trade Dedmon and maybe that Rockets pick to the Warriors for Jordan Bell? Would love to have him along side Collins imo.
Yeah the feedback I’m getting is that I shouldn’t have used Golden State to compare. The reason I used Barnes, though is because he and Taurean Prince are both SF’s
No problem, I think you could have a future in it. Good luck!
agree! very excited and hopeful for the future of the team
ok fine.  /u/martinsek grammarly?
That’s actually pretty sexy 
Well since the link I posted is the official NBA store you can be pretty sure it's gonna be these exactly.
Joe Johnson for sure, made us relevant while he was here. 
I liked ZaZa. Sue me I don't care
I honestly think that starting 5 from 2014-2015 was prime franchise-best hawks. 
you say that about even korver and coach bud? I think for sure them plus ISO Joe are hawks legends. they made the team relevant and served the team in a positive way for years
I met Zaza at the restaurant he used to own called Flips Burgers so I will always love zaza, he gave me a free milkshake. 
Korver did not make the team relevant lol 
My mistake. I forgot about the new power ranking and all that. So, you’re right about that. I do enjoy team basketball setting us apart from the retooling competition. Things are looking up in Atlanta basketball. 
John Collins is nice he was really active in the boards and finishing inside on the Celtics bigs, he looked way more athletic than any of them. Should be solid
He has been telling us all along, just look. 



Start with the name Delaney.

Flip the first 3 letters around to get leDaney

Then capitalize the L, lowcase the D and flip it around to get a b. Leaving you with Lebaney

#Lebaney


He's a great shooter, like around 40% 3P% in college and looks to be continuing that. I think anyone who can shoot like that and doesn't hurt us on defense is definitely useful. 
He’s a beast. Great in the pick and roll, good hustle player and plays well with Taurean Prince. Brown/Tatum are looking pretty solid too, can’t wait to watch all these guys develop 
Well you should have them moved to your front yards by now. Cause he looks super promising
damn collins is good af boi steal of the draft. and w our lottery SG/PF this year we gonna be good again in a year or two. 
With your own players at that. 
I have a lot of love for Collins, dude is gonna be really good.
I'd like to keep bazemore. seems like a great guy with a great work ethic. I'd love to see him be a good influence on the younger guys
Ain’t no team out there that can take on $30 million a year right now 
He seems like a guy that will age well into when we compete. He's a fantastic chemistry guy for us, and I think he can be a great team guy to help lead under Bud
No worries, it wasn't a rule or anything but it would be good to do from now on. 
Yeah I think he'll be loyal enough to take a smaller contract in a few years and stay with us. He can be a great spark of the bench once we have an actually skilled team again imo.
Hopefully he falls because of not playing in college and we can scoop him without our first pick if he really is good 
Nah give me one of the sure things.
No way I'd draft him with a top 5 pick, considering the other talents available.
The full package
No such thing as a sure thing in the draft
Okay Bulls and Kings won yesterday so let's unironically win this one I want nothing more than us to end the Boston streak. 
Got us some quality Bud Face a lil bit ago lol
Got to appreciate the home crowd giving the Hawks a standing ovation for that win
Niq and Bob roasting Smart lmao
That Marcus Smart flopping though 
Can Smart get fined, preferably twice? 
It would be so satisfying to send them home with a L.
Smooth seas never made a skilled sailor or whatever
Kent is a great guy thats why. Doesnt matter how he's playing.
Love me some Bob 
I don't know, I doubt you could stop the post-game "Hawks remain undefeated as they extend their winning streak" threads, haha
true
Even if we win, we lost, and that's a win in my book
Another easy W
We win regardless but more importantly we need to give Boston a fat L
I thought we would save our win but winning the post game kinda makes me think the hawks don't care about this one but if they feel like winning they could easily do so
Thanks!!
You mind if I post this to r/NBA? This is really good
Nice. But what's up with the blocks? 4.1, then up the minutes and the stats go down. I know he won't keep up the stats most likely. 
also kyle kuzman its playing a lot better than him
love too be a lakers fan on the hawks sub
I love me some JC. I want to know why in limited minutes he had higher blocks, then scaling up in per 36 were he had lower.
Lol goddamn two years ago Horford 'wasn't a star' and now Celtics fans are talking about him being an underdog in the MVP race. 
I honestly think 6 flags in Georgia is one of the top 6 6 flags
@me
I miss Free Talk Friday being on Thursdays
Saw Protomartyr last week and[ they are very good live](https://youtu.be/q7oxlCdYNl4) go see them if you get the chance
lmao that thread on the front page of /r/nba right now is hilarious. “He’s not getting MVP talk because Al has no narrative” uh no maybe it’s because he scores 15ppg which is completely average?
this sub should just be r/thrashfan lmao 
Honestly I would prefer trade him for another pick so I can get a better version pg like Collin Sexton he’s good at playmaking and lifting up the momentum game 
I don't see it. I like Dennis and he still has room to improve but as of right now he is absolutely garbage at defense and still doesn't run a team well. The defense part is so frustrating because he has all the tools to be a plus defender, he is just severely lacking in effort and awareness. On the offensive end, he still has ways to go in terms of running a team. There's way too many possessions where he just pounds the rock around the perimeter without anyone else touching the ball. He will never be a #1 guy on an elite team but he's definitely a top tier #3 option on a championship contending team
No, I think there's an element of truth there. TP is playing pretty well for a sophomore, but he's also really old for a soph. I'd be happy if he turns into a good two-way starter who can put up the same stats that he does now on a 55 win team.
theyd turn the most downvoted comment in history into the most upvoted 
lol yes i guess you could say that
fucking right 
Pretty soon we'll have Bob and Nique calling them daddies
we've memed this nickname into existence. I can die happy now
oh my goodness just when i thought peak Bob was calling john jenkins JOHNNY CASH MONEY, he has gone and topped himself again.  this is the greatest thing i've ever heard today
I have watched most of the games with their commentary and it's the first time I can recall hearing it. 
retooling while fairly competitive.
what tank top did u buy for ur mom

The more I think about it the more I think it's gonna be bomba. I think bud's gonna make him the player he wanted dwight to be.
Nah. Honestly Ayton first, then Luka, then Porter, and then and only then Bagley
Luka ain’t a point guard. I don’t him being the primary ball handler and being able to drive well enough to be a point guard. He’s the perfect secondary ball handler Bud wants though. And if he becomes an elite shooter, he’s perfect.
Normally this is where I'd say something about retooling while remaining competitive, but let's be honest, this one wasn't particularly competitive
That sidebar pic is magnificent (and well-deserved).

It feels wrong to say this, but December 15th needs to hurry up and get here so we can trade Dedmon and Babbit and those guys -- they're winning us too many games!
Good to see Denício Shrodéras back on track. Everyone else needs to calm down though, winning by 46 points isn't supposed to happen to a retooling while remaining competitive team 
Retooling while becoming dominant 
Games like this are great, they keep the team sharp and motivated to continue growing. Winning through losing is all gravy but every now and then you need to win by yamming all over some fools.
This team is so much fun to watch regardless of the result
This was actually really enjoyable. Great work all round by everyone.
i heard this in Bob's voice in my head when i read it due to your flair.  so good.
You’re a celeb now. Will u reply to me so I can be internet famous?
To be fair, you have to have a high IQ to retool while being competitive
I love 21 but there's no way he's good live
I hit the bumper at the end once. It was the scariest shit ever... loved that ride.
Princes who rise to power through their own skill and resources (their "virtue") rather than luck tend to have a hard time rising to the top, but once they reach the top they are very secure in their position. This is because they effectively crush their opponents and earn great respect from everyone else. Because they are strong and more self-sufficient, they have to make fewer compromises with their allies.
Everyone chill, it was an embarrassing loss but we will be fine 
I'll wrangle those dad's for free
This performance is hilarious to watch 
Dennis is so fucking good. It’s honestly a pleasure watching him play basketball.
I, for one, am not going to sit here and accept my favorite draft prospect becoming some pacific time purple boi. There’s still time to turn things around Hawks
lol Willy Cauley Stein was trying not to rap along to Bodak Yellow but he couldn't stop himself. Highlight of the night for Sacramento 
man John Collins is so lovely
Talks about how good Dedmon is from the line, begins to miss his next two.

Just Atlanta Hawks things.
The Kings are more committed to the tank.
Yooooooo Dedmon winning me BIG money on FD let's goooooo
Oh how quickly 30 becomes 20. Just like we drew it up
I LOVE HAWKS BASKETBALL
Collins has the best hands. So much better than watching Howard stumble around and drop passes in the paint.
I wanna see some more DMoney action, what a night!!!
God damn lol. I am disappointed though I wanted to win by 50
Solid fucking win. Don't do it too often
This is the best start we've had in a very long time
we're gunna win by 60 
Killer Mike's SWAG Shop. Can't get much more Atlanta
I really do think the Kings will win
That was funny as hell! 
Cool thing about this game is even if we win, we still lose.
thats the good stuff
But If we lose we still win. It’s a win win lose lose situation. 
Yeah you’re right. I would have rather just listened to the song without him there
Imagine playing basketball your whole life and the first thing anyone says about you is that you take charges. We’ve missed you charge daddy
Nice to see Malcom improving 
Goliath at SFoG but Skyrush at Hershey is of course amazing. The Gs are pretty intense but sit on the inside and you'll be ok. 

Also, true enthusiasts will always point you towards Mindbender if you're an Atlanta native. It's the best Schwarzkopf.

Just saw this but thanks for the s/o. Tank for Bagley!
better than delaney 
We need a full 48min Delaney game to win this! 
Best seats of my life tonight. If any of yall see a young dude actin a fool behind hawks bench. Its me
i don't like the delaney/taylor backcourt. both guys need the ball in their hands to be effective. hope bembry takes delaneys minutes + some of babbits when he comes back.
Am at game and its 64-35 at the half. Feels good to keep the longest win streak in the NBA alive. 
Imagine when he's back, we'll be even more undefeated by then!
Well, he is not bad. He is just not NBA level. If you moved him to a European team he would look awesome (starter, frequent double-doubles) just like he did at Lokomotiv Kuban. The reasons he is not NBA level are that he lacks athleticism plus his FG/3P% is average (37.7/27.8% NBA career stats). Great solution if you want to tank (retool, while remaining competitive) and that's it. 
Man this just shows how talented NBA players are compared to G-League players
How can we get two top 5 picks?
But my Dennis! And more importantly, our own pick next year. That’s van untouchable. Without that we have nothing to play for next year
Good bot
Damn u smart
We swindled THJ. i thought that was pretty clear from the first sentence? 
Which one of these three options? 

Ask Mike Muscala his favorite movie? 

Ask John the Baptist to help you repent from your sins? 

Or poll the Cicada audience? 
Are you telling me that a minor league soccer team is more popular than the only sports franchise to beat Bill Russell in the finals?  smdh
Fair enough, when coming from less ironic subs it came be easy to miss the jokes and irony here.
I can’t believe I’m subscribed to a Hawks sub and it’s in my top 5 favorite. 

What a time to be alive 
It will get like 82 upvotes and a couple of Knicks fans being like "Hawks fans are the best shitposters LAWL"
Brings a tear to my eye. My post, though my idea was The Priest lmao
Doncic's floor is sky high, I think he could come in and immediately be a 15/4/3 player. Unfortunately I don't think his ceiling is that high, he probably caps out as a 22/7/4 player which is still great, but it's 'best option on a 48 win team' great and not superstar great.

Bagley seems hyper raw to me in terms of actual game sense, I see the potential but I could also see him busting.

I'm 85% sure MPJ turns into a better Tobias Harris.

I probably take Doncic even with the limited upside because I'm a sucker for team basketball.
I know how you feel about Doncic. It's hard to think of wing players in the NBA that are genuinely dominant without being explosive athletes. (Larry Bird... Paul Pierce I guess... anyone else?) And yet Doncic is somehow the best player in his hemisphere. So he must have *some* kind of intangibles that are just off the chart, which is what makes him so intriguing IMO. With those other guys, you know a little more what they're projecting to look like: Bagley's the next KG/AD/Bosh, sure; Porter's the next KD/PG, why not; Ayton is like Embiid but healthier, sounds good to me. But Doncic? What player comparison is there for this guy?

At this point, just the intrigue alone is enough to make me want to roll the dice on him. Call me a gambler but I like to swing for the fences with draft picks, and Doncic seems like the ultimate high-risk high-reward player out of the top five guys.

Let's be real here, though -- if the Hawks can finish at the bottom of the standings, they'll have a guaranteed top-4 pick, which is a no-lose situation in my book. I'd be freaking thrilled with any of these guys.
Why are you guys talking all these top draft picks right now? You guys do know were undefeated now right? We wont be in the lottery
The comparison I really like for Doncic is James Harden. Doncic is not as athletic as him, but can be a better defender. On offense, they both have the old man's game, knowledge how to use angles, great feel for the game, great shooters, great passing ability...
I feel like your probably right on Doncic's ceiling for most teams but he just feels like the perfect prospect for Coach Bud and together with him I can see him turning in to an insanely good player provided the team around him can also play well enough - we can't be like some other teams and just expect him to do everything (like the Pels with AD before Boogie came over). But with guys like Dennis, Doncic, Bembry, Prince and Collins and a good use of our cap-space this coming two off-seasons I see our system flourishing like it did in the 60-win season - with hopefully more young talent in the roster
Bomba is a winner in every sense and has overcome adversity in so many ways. A guy like that can really be special. Good points. He has another brother in and out of prison I believe. He's been through a lot but keeps balling out of his mind. Legit Jesus Shuttlesworth type stuff.
We are going undefeated and winning the championship but will also get the number one draft pick through sheer tyranny of will.
I understand and can respect that rationale. The point of winning the lottery is so you can draft franchise changing talent.

That said, Doncic is just SO EFFIN GOOD, RIGHT NOW that I want him on our team. Dude is carving up Euroleague and already went shot for shot with some of the NBA's best. He already has all the tools, and he fundamentally understands how to play. Literally the only mark I have against him is he lacks explosiveness (and he has SG handles rather than PG handles).

I really don't know. Can you carry a team to a championship as a perimeter player with average athleticism? Part of me says that the athleticism is vital for breaking the seal, while the other part of me is screaming fuck the athleticism this kid is brilliant at basketball.
For sure. I like the *idea* of Doncic because he's not really like anything else we've seen in the league, but at the same time he could have a Bargnani-type career arc and we'd all just say "oh yeah, of course, that was easy to see coming."
[and i love your wall](https://youtu.be/zOt6ppIBOd4)

96? They're going to get up 2-0 in the Finals, then Commissioner Silver will just give them the trophy? 

Nice.
The post season will just jump straight to the finals where the undefeated hawks claim an astounding 14-0 sweep against the warriors.
"I don't like that Baze has the ball"- Me to my roommate literally right before he lost it
That was some *clutch* retooling while remaining competitive right there
Perfect game
How many games have we had a lead in the 4th quarter?
Nice buzzer beater to win the game. Closest we came to losing this season
Doesn’t make him worth $70M
No one who got paid in 2016 is worth what they're getting paid. 
Well, he had to shoot the free throws.
bud doesnt start rookies fresh of da boat so to speak. 

and because he fouls every 5 minutes of game-time so he'd be out by 30 mins anyways 
Anybody else think Rathbun is the best announcer in broadcasting history? He is outstanding! Big reason why I became a huge hawk liker.
So happy to see Cavanaugh play. As a classmate of his at GW, we all knew he could ball out. If he went to a big name school he would be starting. Happy to see the hawks give our boy a chance!
We're intentionally trying to lose now right?
Another hard fought win for us
Cavaveitall.

We have to make it look like we're trying to win (remaining competitive) but if we do win it would make it tougher to have a high pick in next year's draft (retool) 
I think Schroder giving it up to Baze there pretty much confirmed this 
Lol you tried

^^^^I ^^^^swear ^^^^there's ^^^^a ^^^^robot ^^^^for ^^^^everything ^^^^around ^^^^here
:3
lol ducking autocorrect strikes again
He could just be dealing with it cause he's a boss. Here's to hoping he's actually okay, he's gonna be critical for us this year
fucking love it this is the true way to TANK
Big media are interested in big popularity teams, nothing new or interesting there, let's not go all victim complex-y. The only recent real success we had was the 60 win season and we all know how that ended, also we have no stars or huge prospects that are interesting to talk about outside of a team-level.
Yeah... True. 
I don't know who this guy is but it probably means we aren't interested in Okafor which is for the best I guess.
Oh I'd love this
Good move to let him pick up some minutes and experience, since he won't get any with us this probably anyways (remember that we did this with Bembry and Prince as well last year and that turned out great).
Oh no, are they ok?
They're fine. Still undefeated.
The more highlights I see of Collins the more he reminds me of Shawn Kemp. If they work on his defense and outside shooting some more, I don't see why he can't get there.
i️ enjoyed i­t­, finished my handle of whiskey to i­t­! cheers cicadas
Still mediocre at best 
I like you a lot better as an SG than a PG that's for sure.
If getting a good pick want the goal, preferably on a different roster
At absolute best
I’m fine with that.
Tay Tay retooling while remaining competitive until Ed Sheeran and Adele decline from their primes for sure
"Taylor the Swift" would be a good nickname for Isaiah Taylor, that's all I'm saying
We are literally in MyGm this year with a great draft class of a talent from the west coast, Euroleague star and a superstar SF. 
Doncic with our own pick, Bagley with the Wolves pick and Ayton with the Rockets pick - rebuild done: Dennis / Doncic / Bagley / Collins / Ayton. 
6 is Sexton imo, but that's not worth tanking for. Bridges or Sexton aren't franchise centerpieces they are just good.
I'm falling in love with Ayton more and more every time I see him play at Zona 
He's the best young international player ever hands down 
I doubt it. He's gonna be a top 5 pick most likely
This is legit the most enjoyable team to watch tank. Not even upset how we've been playing at all
Shoutout to John Collins for getting the ball after a missed FT, giving it to the female ref and giving her a nice pat on the ass
I was pretty proud of Bazemore and Collins tonight. Baze actually looked kinda competent, and Collins held his own against Drummond. 
tank you very much 
Seriously it makes me happy to know that we aren't completely sucking every night. Bud does a good job of maximizing the value of his roster.
Told you guys it could be fun. I watched tons of Sixers games during The Process and seeing RoCo, Rich Boy Holmes, and TJ develop into actual NBA players was fun AF.
It's fun to watch your team play when you don't even necessarily want them to win. You just get to purely watch them play and see the intricacies of basketball rather than getting all stressed out about every single possession. If they win, cool, it's still fun to win. If they lose, it's one step closer to getting a good pick.
And minimizing the wins. Bud the master of optimization.
I'm actually really happy for Andre Drummond figuring out his free throws. Good for you man.
This is legit the best 2-10 team ive ever seen. Playing the best teams in the league close, taking L's for draft picks from middling teams and beating scrubs ^^^kek

Nice
Looks like now is the best time to summon it ...
Step 1. Splooge self.

Step 2. Enjoy the first NBA team to go 82-0

Step 3. Enjoy the Hawks going 16-0 in the playoffs.

Step 4: Enjoy the offseason when Lebron signs with the Hawks.

Step 5: Enjoy 2018-2019 when the Hawks go 83- -1.
Extremely excited about Teagueposting making a return.
I believe we are talking about Olin "Tiger" Teague who was the representative for Texas's 6th congressional district from 1946-1978. He was born in Oklahoma and raised in Arkansas, so clearly Texas did the original Teague swindling.
I guarantee we win tonight 
lmao at his defense so high
Needs more shoulder tattoos. 
I bet we have more games with 34+ assists than them though.
Why did they even mention the hawks lol?
Exactly, espn always has to nitpick to make it seem like we are the worser team.
We are second, lol
Because the Hawks are the NBA's second most favorite team
Welcome /u/Steffnov ! I see you're migrating from the dreary Falcons sub. Here we are undefeated and looking forward to the championship (draft) 
My favorite type of humor? Certainly schadenfreude
It's just for better grouping when we are sent to Bud's Basketball Summer Camp.
YALL GOT ME GOOD
To be fair, to stop moderating we'd first have to start moderating at some point.
you got a sauce I'm intrigued i wanna read the original 
lmao how is that real this website is such a hellhole
I think the starting lineup is going to win the MVP this year, time feels right for it. 
I know this may be a controversial statement but, no I really don't think so. 
I made it myself and asked the mods to give it to me and they did, but good news - I am now a mod myself so I'll try to give you one if I figure out how that works. 

edit: Ta-da!
This is awesome. Thanks for sharing. 
First simulation:
ATL with the 1st, 22nd, and 28th picks. Not crazy to think we could package those together into another top 15.

Schlenk with two top 15 picks and Bud doing his thing? I can only get so erect.
Hope this becomes a regular thing (sounds like it will) - I've been really jealous of the Cavs of having this because it gives such a good insight in the locker room and the personalities of the team. Can't wait to hear all the guys come along during the season. 
Is the sound all muffled from being recorded inside of a tank?
Moose only being able to say "Respect" when he saw Curry with Baze 😂😂😂
They're talking about needing to get more comfortable on mic for new episodes, what to do on new episodes and who they should get as guests throughout the podcast though, so it seems like it will be a regular thing. 
Yeah they were kind of mumbling their way through a lot of it, but they mentioned maybe having a drink or two before the next one to loosen up so that could potentially be fun
I’ll be tuning in. Baze seems like a cool dude and he was a good guest on OG Road Tripping last year. 
This shit is great 
Is this considered a normal summon or a special summon?
He's a building block for sure. He's never gonna be an all-star but he's already a solid starting SF for us that a lot of teams would kill for us in the current NBA. He's developing pretty quickly and his defense is top-notch already. 
He's good. Most likely our starting 3 for the future. His floor is a 3 and d player and who doesn't need those.
gotcha. yeah, was thinking a deal where you got okafor, holmes and stauskas and we got belinelli and prince would make sense, but seems like prince is too valuable to make that work. in general, i think holmes would be a nice fit with schroder and you guys have a ton of wings, but if price is basically danny green and you just got dedmon on a nice 2 year deal, then it prob doesnt work. 
I see his best case scenario would be like an elite role player who isn't an all-star but gets paid like one like Otto Porter
right, so we take your expiring contract - belinelli - and give you two guys on expiring contracts as fliers - okafor and stauskas. then holmes, a big, wouldve made more sense in your rebuild than prince, another wing. ultimately though, prince is better than i realized when i started looking into this, so the whole thing is moot. 
:D
Just..play in Georgia Tech's place, strike a deal so Philips Arena gets a piece of the revenue. It's a lot better than playing in a stadium that looks like it wasn't even completed.
Good point.
Those suites at the top were also more designed for viewing hockey, but that's obviously no longer an issue (RIP Thrashers). 
As a C's fan I am impressed with Schroder. He looks great out there. That high pick and roll with Dedmon in the 2nd quarter was absolutely eviscerating the Celtics. 
Eleven straight. Might be the best team in league history
Schroder was put on this earth to be the Anti-Celtic. Every Hawk's C's game I watch that skunk head mother fucker makes my blood boil Good game Hawks fans. To beat Cleveland and come that close to the actual best team in the East says a lot about your team. Best of luck to ya.
Celtics fan, I come in peace. Got a huge laugh out of the title, you guys were dangerous tonight. I hope to see more of you guys upsetting teams in the future, I would love a good run against y'all in the playoffs!
Lol. You guys should switch to birdwatching.
Please don’t. I can’t deal with 7th or 8th any more. I would much rather 16th.
There's certain games this team just plays harder for. It will be fine. Also the team will start considering trading or resting players as the season wears on. Right now they're mostly evaluating talent. For players like Dedmon, Babbitt, or Belinelli, it's showcasing trade value. 
Welcome to my prediction since last year’s playoffs 
For an undefeated team, all of our games have been surprisingly watchable, and dare I say, exciting.
please god no i don't wanna be in the playoffs this is **RETOOLING WHILE REMAINING COMPETITIVE™**, not **RETOOLING WHILE REMAINING COMPETITIVE AND WINNING GAMES**. 
We're friggin 2-9 and are going to lose like 60 games this year, why the hell wouldn't we make light of the situation?  
Says the guy who's football team blew a 28-3 lead in the Super Bowl. Enjoy the basement.
I was selected to perform a skit alongside harry during a timeout once. He wasn't very friendly to me tbh he was cursing at me because I was fooling around too much. 
Harry the Hawk is the best father we could have.
dominique just called Kyrie “Uncle Buck” lmao
Celtics might be the most renowned organization for white players but we've mastered harnessing them
lmao what

Jesus Christ the crowd is silent during this show lol
Bud's got all three PGs with Babbit and Collins, nice
Lol everyone drops the tanking act and gets excited when we're in the lead and then we lose. 
good for you guys
Collins 3 cheap fouls. Delaney turns it over on his first chance. Cmon man.
We need to kick the ball out more
The mega millions NBA lottery! Can't win if ya don't tank- err, retool while remaining competitive!
When Baze is gone I will be so happy. 
If I was in a room with osama hitler and Marcus smart and had a gun with two bullets I’d shoot smart twice 
Monday night, brother. I have to be up at 7 for work and to sit in traffic like most Georgians. 
More like dabbitt amiright
How high are you right now
I'd be pretty pleased
Please god no. All he'll do is take Collins' minutes and he won't fit Bud's system at all. I'm sure there's a place for him in the NBA somewhere, but it's not right now in Atlanta.
If we can get him on a fair contract then sure
Bulls are about to pick him up and force him to learn what a 3 pointer is. If Hoiberg can get Robin Lopez to shoot 3’s, I’m sure he can do it with a 21 year old. 
I want him at the right price. 
Not a fan long-term, but i think we could flip him for more than it will cost to buy him...

I also think guys like Dedmon will be more valuable to contending teams around the deadline.  I would've loved to have had a piece like dedmon on one of the good hawks teams from the past 10 years.
There's always more room in my life for another daddy 
I just don't see bud or schlenk being into this dude. Seems like he's got some character issues, and the fact that he's not exactly the best rebounder and defender and can't stretch the floor with him it just doesn't seem probable
I was thinking about this last night and decided he wouldn't be good for the team, but on a nights sleep, I must say bringing him in would be nice.

Hawks are lacking talent up front aside from Collins and Dedmon, who both look like keepers for sure.

Ilyasova and Muscala have been hampered by injuries and haven't been really good for us at all so far this season.

Plumlee is of course here to sit on that contract and get no minutes.

I am impressed with Babbitt for sure as a backup big.

Would be nice to have a big man rotation of something like Dedmon, Collins, Okafor and Babbitt towards the end of the season. Muscala and Ilyasova would be far better off on another team in my opinion.
FIRST QUESTION: DOES HE PLAY UNO THO?
You gotta get him. We're in the midst of a rebuild anyway. This is a guy who put up 17/7 in his rookie year. He's only 21 years of age with plenty of room to improve. His defense is certainly a problem but I think this coaching staff will do wonders for him on that end. I mean they made Hardaway Jr a respectable defender during his tenure here, i'm sure they can do the same with Okafor. Heck, even better if we can find a way to send back one of Baze or Plumlee + an asset to the 6ers in the trade. Would be nice to have more financial flexibility for the upcoming offseason
For sure. I have very little doubt that Collins will be able to develop a useful outside shot. He's got a smooth stroke
;)
This is how you successfully retool while remaining competitive
This is gonna be sweet. Mike and Baze are the perfect pairing for it. The first exchange of Baze telling the long story and then Moose saying "after the first game they told us we were supposed to lose" was hilarious. 
yesssssssssssssss give me more baze
This is awesome, I can't wait
Quite remarkably, /u/notoriou5_hig pulled 2 ultra rares from his pack. 
I'm not a Hawks fan but this may be one of the few subreddits I make sure to read every single day. I absolutely love what you're doing /u/BestCruiser along with the whole subreddit!

Keep on winning while retooling!
Absolutely. Dennis had better go off again tonight.
I'd rather lose 82 but if we have to win let's beat the Snek!

Affirmative 
Babbitt will score 43 points in the first quarter 
Gotta keep our head up after snapping that win streak, and start another!!
Teague actually had a really efficient game against the Hornets last night. 18pts/12ast/5reb. He's quietly putting together his best season since the HOX 60 WIN LEGEND SEASON.
the magic
If Budrick doesn't get this sign our perfect season is in jeopardy.
I was convinced that last shot was going in to make us do even more retooling...

I just wish there were more teams in the league trying to remain competitive.  It’s not even fun to win so much.

I come home from work and my wife tells me she's pregnant. Then I turn on this game. This is the best day of my life. Love you guys!!!! LOVE THIS SUB!!!
Good game Cavs bros! Y'all gonna be spooky next year. Keep your heads up, y'all have lots to be proud about!
I'm jumping the gun way too quick, but IT looks legit and we haven't had a competent PG duo since Teague was still here.
Honestly all I ever wanted from this season was to beat the Cavs, Warriors, and Celtics and get whupped everywhere else, this season has been a blast so far
We tried to choke so hard. So many missed free throws. Good thing the memes were on our side.
If the Cavs keep this up I think it'll be cool if we make the playoffs
Great job guys! Hope yall keep winning! :)
Look at all those ones in our win percentage. 
15 is more than 1 so that means we’re the best.

Also my prediction was that we would be 6th to 7th and it turns out we’re 1st 
No one, not even the Wolves, are going to eat my Sweet King Tiger Tank.
what the christ is happening lol
LMAO. What a joke. The fix is in.
Best IT in the league
starting to get nervous...what if we actually win this? We wont be tied for #1 place in tanking anymore.
pistons fan here please beat the cavaliers so that we can stay on top of the central division also i love waking up to headlines complimenting our good start and slamming the cavs start
IT is getting better and better
Blocking foul lol. How obvious can they be
Falcons lose... Dennis wins? 
lol  
Hawks tries to tank.  
But Lue deny
Offense looking real crisp. No unnecessary passes, and we're hitting the open shots. love it
Love just standing there under the basket. 
I like this. This is good.
dennis is a pretty boi

THIRTEEN STRAIGHT??
We're the best team in the East
I’d really rather not see the win streak snapped here. 
Love u korver <3
You guys earned that W. Nice fought, keep it up!!
winning without our star player, Belinelli!
Ok Korver stop making 3s now
LOL
Good W!!!
Please win more
I thought Babbitt was moose multiple times tonight lol
Same here. I don't think we win with Moose out there 20 minutes
Exactly
We sure do sign a lot of people I've never heard of.
This man's last name starts with CAV. It ends with Nah. Cavs, naw. Atlanta in 4 against LeBron and Wade for sure.
I guess it's better than signing retreads like Monta Ellis or Jordan Hill.
Time to go for our third straight win at Cleveland. Should be an easy win
So with both Moose and Ersan out I guess Babbitt is starting at the 4 today lol
Winning*
How many stars is he?
I think exodia as hawks january 2015 player of the month would fit better. Dominique should definitely be a god card though
Nothing to do with us but good to see the Bulls winning as well!
best posture in the league
ok fine but you have to post them

Basically they were getting people to sign up for the Hawks membership for a chance to win 2 VIP tickets and I told my brother not to waste his time signing up since this team is trash, and tickets are cheap and available anyways. 

They were defending our team saying we're moving in a better direction now (which is true) but I was so frustrated seeing the roster that we've put together so we got into a good debate about how promising our future is. We went back and forth, but I thought it was nice to see representatives passionate about the team.
He'd get more if he could actually make a layup.
We're they smiling and saying "awww c'mon!" ?
Nah they were really going in, like I insulted their momma. It was nice to see, they were real fans of the team for sure. 
Love that
'member when Schröder had a supporting cast? 
Nice to see LGP out here supporting the other winning team in Atlanta
Good to see Dorsey hit some shots, he hit something like 40% from 3 in college. Future role player of Hawks championship.
JC not looking too hot
that boy taylor is quick
Better than the 1992 Dream Team 
That good huh?
Ask Chris Paul if he's ever jealous that because of Jeff Teague he's only the second greatest PG from Wake Forest
Better be shrek 
This is all true provided your favorite player is Gordon Hayward
NYPD and a talentless cesspool of a human took out 2 of our best players for no reason. I'm still pissed and wonder how far we would have taken it. 
Nearly half the team is on the injury sheet, nice. 

(also in an alternate reality we're on pace for a 10-70 season after one of the more easier stretches of the season, anyone still believe we're winning 30-35 and making the playoffs?)
Maybe we can at least let them think they are going to win because of Deshaun Watson. RIP
Gonna be an easy win. 9-0 here we come
Hypothetically in this alternate reality, in which we are not retooling while remaining competitive, I believe we win around max25 to 30 games. I’m glad we don’t have to worry about that though since we are undefeated and remaining competitive.
thanks good joke that i clearly didn't specifically try to avoid.
I for one, enjoy watching us win more than I enjoy watching us lose. I was actively cheering for it last year so this would happen
The ultimate win would be having the first or second pick in next years draft.  
i think after the 2nd-3rd loss i was pretty ok with it already. the first win felt good and i wasn't so sure about tanking but the last few games just really woke me up. this ain't a good basketball team rn. its all good tho because this team desperately needs a superstar. the draft is obviously all about luck but having a top 5 pick helps our chances of finding that guy
You just gotta look for other things and watch what other teams are doing to be great. We HAVE to do this if we want to be good in 5 years. It's our best chance at getting a top 10 player through the draft. Until then, check out Oladipo in Ind, Giannis in Mil, and Det about to make some noise. Also fuck the Celtics. 
I didn't say we did, they were saying that lol
Yeah no one is firing Bud, if anything Schlenk better work his ass off to keep him happy and positive so he wants to stay.
This would be funny if we were tanking but we arent
Ahh I see the confusion. To an outsider, it surely looks like tanks, but look closer and you can see that it's actually Retooling While Remaining Competitive
A great sixth man is pretty much a starter
"Bring the whole family out to see 21 Savage perform at halftime!"
Do any of you guys have any good jeff teague pics?

self deprecating humor is my favorite style.
We're tanking, Millsap was incredibly important and letting him walk has hurt the team a lot (see our record without him last year, 1-10). Dennis is good but inefficient and can't do it all alone. We have half the team injured. Our best players are all under 25 so lacking experience. 
right on
The cicada theme is available at all times if you hit the "Cicada Theme" button on the top right of the sidebar. 
It's a shame you guys are not tanking, this guy would look good next to the German and John the Baptist.
If Bud is playing JC exclusively as a center now already I don't see him moving to PF ever, especially since Collins' has been talking about wanting to gain a bunch of weight. 

But yeah that line-up would be pretty ideal. I don't have faith in Dennis ever becoming the first option on a championship team but he's competent enough as a third option. So if we have Doncic becoming a star, Prince and JC at least becoming solid starters (and hopefully better) and use our cap-space for a good FA we could be back in the playoffs next year already.
Eh, he's already playing for a professionally run team with good management, I don't think he wants to take a step down in that regard.
I'd like to see Tattoo Shoulders Dad with a bit more muscle.
Fine you take him. The hawks like to retool after winning the conference anyways. At this rate, we'll have him in 3 years tops.
[me right now](https://streamable.com/y0uo8)
Last season's longest win streak was 7. We've already broken that in the first 8 games of the season. Remarkable stuff
 activated tank mode in the 4th quarter. Used the first 3 to show that we COULD have won if we really wanted to.

For real though Hawks are 1-7 after tonight. They've been tied or ahead in the fourth quarter in 6 of the 8 games and every game has been competitive. Dennis, Taurean, Collins, Isaiah Taylor, and Bembry in his one game+preseason have looked good. We get to have fun, close games but still add a top 3 pick to that.
congrats on the win guys. Schroder is legit.
Damn, we’re still unbeaten. This is cool
Blazers fan here. I just want to say I always check your post game threads because the titles and content are beautiful. Keep up the great work you magnificent meme lords. You guys might just go 82-0 this year.
This is the best result for us
I know you guys want to make some noise but it isn't realistic to expect to win this game. Wish you guys the best going forward, you got a talented bunch.
This game worried me more than the second Rockets game. You guys have a really good team in a good place. I've always been happy to root for the Hawks when they're not playing the Sixers and this game showed that they really care. Best part of rebuilding teams is finding good players that wouldn't get minutes on another team so I'm super interested in how the Hawks play this year until they make the playoffs next year
Damn that was a true ankle breaker, not one of those BS front page of /r/nba bs clips where the guy gets tripped.
More pixels plz
If u assemble the entire 2015 starting line up do you automatically win like Exodia?

It makes me laugh every time 
What is up with Marcos legs when he shoots lol
BREAKING NEWS: BOB THINKS NIQUE IS PRETTY
Confession: *I wish we were tanking.*

It would make for much better memes.
Wow, Collins is amazing. His off the ball movement is on point, he keeps the opposing bigs honest by not allowing them to commit to the driving guard for risk of a lob
*authentic comment incoming* You can tell Collins is really soaking up everything the coaching staff is telling him...the kid's gonna be alright :)
Taylor is the best PG in the NBA
First!
God I don't understand some of Marcos shots lol
Marco sucks lol. 
lmao dude looks like baby Barbosa
I just realized we need a sub flair for all these wins. Reverse Cicada's. Locusts anyone?
tank for 3 years, draft 2 bust centers in between drafting him, wait 2 years to watch him play. are you sure you can handle that? 
First!
I don't even need someone that good. I need someone with the media presence and involvement with the fans
3 years is nothing lmao
First
They're denying inside passes and anything in the post. Philly is just getting hot, nothing you can do about it. We don't have the talent to stop everything
We aren't even covering them on 3s. I guess we are committing so much inside that we can't stop them from 3 but they are shooting 66% lol
Fresh
Another Jdirt Lukewarm take inbound! Buckle up, Dennis scores a season high 32, Muscala gets eaten alive by Joel, offensive rebounds don't come easy and the hawks lose (win) in a blowout.
The Sixers are definitely my second favorite team. They are everything we aspire to be. Joel Embiid is probably my favorite non Hawk player too. The dude has such a big personality and hall of fame talent. If it weren't for John the Baptist, Ben Simmons would be the easy choice for rookie of the year. He's also my number one draft prospect I've watched in my like 5 years of doing draft stuff. The Sixers' fan culture, at least from what I've seen, is awesome. The trust the process movement is incredible 
Copypasta? Lmao
lol he had a career high 30 mins played last night, what all star has a fuckin 30 mins played as their career high... bruh thats only 62% of the game lol.

Hawks > Warriors fucking confirmed boys!!
Man I can't even remember the last time we had a respectable ft%, the 2015 season maybe? 
The article talks about how he was hesitant to give up the GM position and his position on going into rebuilding before the draft earlier this year, that's probably what they were talking about on those podcasts.

The article is a really good read on where we are as an organization, def give it some time if you want to know what's the deal with where we are and ish
Will do! Thanks!
Thank you for the non meme informative content. Good read
David Aldridge always puts out the best stuff when it comes to the Hawks. My favorite part of this article was when Schlenk basically confirmed that we're going undefeated this year:

> Listen. You guys won 43 games. You want to win 43 games again?

Damn straight.
Really interesting read on how Schlenk got everybody on board with the tank, How Bud handled losing the GM part of the job and how he tried to keep Millsap anyways.
Wondering what kind of return we could get on Bellinelli and Dedmon. I love their games so far but I'm sure they'd be happier on a good team. I kind of hope we keep Ilyasova as our trusty vet for the foreseeable future.
Schlenk is the tank commander we all know and love.


Btw it's a player option on Dedmon, not team
NBA finals? LeBron to Lakers confirmed?
Sure why not
Lol I remember that. I always wanted to do more with the yugioh idea. You want in?
ah good one
yes kind stranger

>He's a draft and stash.  Way too good to steer the tank.

FTFY
I thought that said BabyHawks I was like aww that’s cute
So how do these things work? Can we still call him up for his remaining days? Or is he stuck in the g-league now? That'd suck if he was only able to get 7(?) days worth of payment with so many days left on the 2 way
2 players get a 2 way contract. He's our best g league player so he is 1 of our 2 that can play in our NBA games and also play in g league games to get better and gain actual NBA exposure. That's the basics. 
Welcome aboard the not-tank. Just a quick correction: It's Atlantans.
No offence but I clearly know better than you only ever having lived in Australia and I know for certain it’s Alatiananians.
You're hired, welcome aboard!

those fools. with every good preformance, the doncic slips further and further into our grasp
No chance that’s worth $19 mil a year.... that’s worth the super-max that Curry and Westbrook got
John with a perfect shooting game, just another reason why we're undefeated
Damn you scared me. I haven’t been watching all season and thought we were actually winning. Whew 
Is it me or has this actually been the one of the better seasons to watch?
A perfect 5/7
I love Booty Taylor
Taylor also seems to pass really well, which we need more of. 
If we keep winning like we did today yes
repetition and commitment to a bit are two of the most important aspects of comedy.
Better than last season that's for sure.
GL;HF 

Hope we are able to help you remain competitive while retooling.
Glad to see the tank is going well. 
Hey so like I'm a Lebron is the GOAT guy but how sure are we that 22 year old Giannis "missed him by a pick" Antetokounmpo isn't the best player in the world?
Being able to watch a game before 1AM is such a great thing
The Tank is strong. 
Are the hawks winning? 
Hey hawks fans. Hold tight its gonna be a long season. Hope u handle it well. Best wishes and good game :)
we're getting 60 wins again, we are undefeated
To be fair that team was never gonna last
Clips 1st round pick from Houston trade (top 3 protected)

TWolves pick (top 14 protected)
Bagley better 
We also have next years Cavs pick (top 10 protected) and all of our own picks.
CHARGE DADDY GOT BONE BASHED 1 TOO MANY TIMES 
Really awesome thing for Taurean to do but why is this video on a dedicated Warriors Youtube channel?
I was being sarcastic too :3
[Change this face, be happy, enjoy it!] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZgU0cT_TfI)
Good bot
I know Hardaway isn't with us anymore, but damn I'm glad we traded the oubre pick to Washington
82-0 here we come, eat your heart out Golden State
As long as Doncic or Porter Jr I’ll be happy 
Got’em right where we want’em!
Stop spamming my newsfeed with bullshit like this. 80% of the posts on this sub are just immature circle jerks. How about some reality

Nothing personal to you, just don’t appreciate loosing my favorite team’s subreddit to a group of fifth graders on a sugar rush
We'd be guaranteed a top 4 pick then. That's about as low as I'd be okay with so we have to go undefeated
[Change this face, be happy, enjoy it!] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZgU0cT_TfI)
good bot
Love that we were able to open the home slate with a win. Millsap can take this loss and go back to the hotel.
Damn it feels good to get that W in the home opener 
Can't you just imagine how amazing this undefeated team is going to be when we add Luka Doncic? 
The video package and standing ovation for Millsap was perfect and I'm very happy I got to be there live to be a part of it. 
Run the jewels was nice though. A little consolation prize for denver
Imo we should just rest the boys so they are In good shape for the finals, this undefeated streak is gonna tire them out by June. 
Put up a good fight, took the L. I'll take it.  
Good win boys 
True; it is nice to watch these young guys progress and our future is most likely pretty bright
Wow I missed the beautiful tunes softly caressing my ear drums. We really have the best organist in the game 
Taurean is killing it from 3 I fucking love it
Looking like the Warriors right now with these 3s
gotta say, I had my doubts. I saw him as just a straight line driver trying to do too much on offense. Now, he looks smooth as butter, both on his threes and finishing at the rim. On top of that, he has elite defense. We got ourselves a real Prime Daddy. <-- you would understand that reference if you've read my latest Chad Flenderson novel
They sell them on the Hawks shop. I do want one myself, but was wondering about the fit and quality
Whenever the in-arena announces he's there, he gets booed.  I'm sure this ceremony is going to be entertaining
aka thanks for paying for our arena renovation with taxpayer money, Mr. Mayor!
Yeah but to be fair he helped quash any chance the Hawks were going to move. 
Imo, Kasim is a pretty sleazy mayor, and I haven't been happy with a lot of decisions he's made. Can't speak for anyone else though.
The Braves still had a lot of unpaid dues towards the city that were disregarded for a decade. I live in Cobb and when I wanted to go hang out with my friends in Vinnings on a Saturday it was fine. Until they showed up! I can't imagine what the traffic around that area is going to be like when they get good again.
You already have our sleeper agent THJ, a great player who will surely cost you losses.

It's too late, you've already fallen victim to ShariaCare, the militant fanatical tank group hell bent on retooling. 
I’m a spectator in this great tank war. I can’t wait to tell my great grandchildren one day about how I had 3rd row seating to the tank to end all tanks. 
Lmao do you see our 5-0 record?
Pure gold!
Counterproposal: We give you dolan and you go super tank.
Timmy’s been throwing some doinkers too. Bud’s choice not to start him is looking wise so far. 
The last and greatest tank off!

Will he play our best player more than 20 minutes a game?
Good read, 5 stars
As long as you are a warm blooded daddy and don't hiss. 
*HAWKS win
Did they win tho?😏
United broke my heart but the Hawks repaired it. What a win
We are now officially the best team in the league, the #1 pick is all but a certainty now.
I know the Bulls suck, but every W counts. Great outing today
ALL WE DO IS WIN WIN WIN NO MATTER WHAT
good win
Glad Bellineli is increasing the trade stock for himself.

Gonna be great to swindle a hope-to-be playoff team for the first rounder! :D
I also like him the most but not because of vegan reasons lol.
He is not an amazing creator, that's the problem with him. He's trying to do too much out there. Out of control drives which result in hilarious bricks or turnovers, off balance mid range pull ups, and wild layup attempts are just some examples. The reason he's shooting such low percentages now are because of his increased ball handling duties. It's just not his strong suit and it'll never be. He's at his best when he defends and gets his scoring from WITHIN the offense - ala DMC when he was with us.
It’s just from what I am seeing, he is getting open and getting good shots, he just can’t score.
A good amount of guards in this league can create like Bazemore when coming off screens. It's nothing special honestly
You can't out-tank a team who starts Delaney. You just cant. He's a great player to have for a tanking team. With that being said tho, i'd rather see Taylor out there. Wanna see what we have in the young fella
Haha. I love that he felt like he should take that shot despite overwhelming evidence to suggest otherwise. 
hey delaney has a huge role to fill this season, can't afford to cut him yet
Be happy we're losing again. 
V funny thx
So the players can see it better 
No chance he gets fired but I am scared he goes once his contract is up if he can get a gig at a better team. Hope he'll be our very own Pop though.
agreed. No clear replacement and he's an incredible coach. makes no sense
I think that might have been the case with the old owners. The new owners are willing to spend and now we have one of the best new training facilities in the NBA with P5 setting up in Atlanta which makes it a good place for players to spend the off-season. 
Schlenk has had his tongue in Bud's ass since he came here, also fuck does he think he is if he doesn't want him? He's the GM lmao he doesn't own the team and Ressler is ALL in on him
Best math in the league
Cute
HOT
Why does this say almost as good and not already better
This sub is great! Once a day you guys post something that gives me a chuckle. I’m glad you guys have a great attitude about rebuilding. 
Pretty much the ECF preview
Love the birthday boys!

Damn i remember my first time smoking weed
Dennis, Doncic, Bembry, TP, Collins

Dennis Bembry, TP, Porter Jr, Collins

Dennis, Bembry, TP, Bagley, Collins

Dennis, Bembry, TP, Collins, Ayton

Dennis, Bembry, TP, Collins, Bamba

One of those better be the Hawks lineup next year 
I'm comfortable with all 5 of those. Which means we'll get the 6th pick.
I like Bridges. He's not someone you rip apart your team for though. I think it's very crucial the Hawks find "the guy" this draft. I think Bridges is a good piece but not the big piece
I'm much more comfortable with the first 3. Ayton and Bamba could easily change this, but I see Doncic, Porter, and Bagley as A+ picks. Bamba and Ayton are A-'s everything below that is a B or lower. Last year I think you needed the first or arguable the second pick to get an A+ guy though and this year it's too 3 arguably top 5.
I'm okay with Miles Bridges or Robert Williams too tbh. Those guys are monsters 
It's been 3 games, he's gonna get more and more PT as he adjusts and learns the defensive schemes just like with a Prince and Bembry last year. Bud knows what he's doing lol
Honestly, we don't expect this team to do anything. So let the newcomer play and get some learning time
You're correct. As a fantasy owner of John Collins, I crave for more playing time for JC. 
When I read ankle break, I thought of Hayward and started to panic. Luckily he was just humiliated instead.
Would have loved to keep him forever, but the pick he was traded for will help us win a championship so it was a noble sacrifice
[Change this face, be happy, enjoy it!] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZgU0cT_TfI)
His legs are intact, but he now lives in the shadow realm. You win some you lose some.
now I'm not usually one to smart shame but you seem like a big ole nerd with his whitey tighties in a bunch, its a subreddit it aint that important fam. Theres a no shitpost filter in your right corner for a reason use it and quit yer bellyaching 
Guys i defended our subreddit on that falcons post. Just want everyone to be aware of that 
Daily hype threads are now gonna be mandatory thing on /r/hawks so that we can be more like the cool and nice and smart football fans: WAKE THE FUCK UP BIRDBROS IT"S GAMEDAY LETS SHOW THOSE BULLS WHO THE REAL PREDATORY BIRDS ARE!!!!!! SHOW OFF YOUR MERCHANDISE TO SUPPORT THE TEAM

Hahaha, this cracked me up. Gotta love obscure Atlanta Sports Reddit humor lol
/r/hawks lol how is this dude a mod when he doesn't even know what subreddit he's on
Somebody on r/Falcons went on a rant the other day saying that the Falcons sub was becoming to much like the Hawks sub because there was a meme on the front page and the mods didn't delete it or whatever.

Edit: here is a link to the original post:

https://www.reddit.com/r/falcons/comments/78gi6c/do_you_mods_need_help_do_we_need_more_of_you_guys/ 
Smh first rule of the copypasta club is that you don't tell people your source material. Your copypasta should be good enough to stand on its own.
This whole thing is such a perfect illustration of the difference between the NBA and the NFL, especially the Mod's top comment - "We'll get right on this" hahaha
thats my mod right there
I think he can average a solid statline but we need to keep in mind that he hasn't really gone up against any really great centers (or teams) yet.
As a Nets fan I was impressed by him. I think he’ll be a solid big in this league. Good athleticism. Good two-way player. Double-double threat. 
The reason why it's such a popular nickname is because "baptizing someone" is a common way of saying "dunking really hard on someone," which is something Collins does all the time, so the play on words was just too perfect to resist
lmao
But he says he loves us and will see us soon, and we'll probably be able to facetime some.
Sometimes we have to sharecare© our daddies with the nice doctors. Some players need an assist off the court, and that assist comes in a sharecare© retreat.
Yet the Timberwolves swindled your Teagues.


Get the Black ones I always think they look the best.
The red is my favorite. I might spring for one that says The Baptist on the bacn
Also I’m buying through DHGate is the quality good?
Red is the best
No I mean the rest of the nba world not the hawks world lol

And not necessarily the Baptist memes but the Baptist becoming an all star in the near future
Good luck. I haven't found any good Hawks jerseys in the short time I looked. The triangles, man. 
I'm just messing with you. I used to be a fan of the red unis, but I just don't like how it works with the pattern. I wish we had ATL on more of our kits though.
*Hardaway from three...* GOOD!!!
Goddamn we're so good that we're either gonna play 84 regular season games or only 2 playoff games?
LMAO you deleted your comments in the FF sub😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I think stat is a bit closer of a comparison. Also Blake was playing more minutes and against starters. 
I see more amare
Yeah that is a good point. He did consistently face more starters than John currently does. However, I think Bud does a good job of letting him see various lineups and run with the starting unit a decent bit throughout games. 
John Collins is a lot better than prince was at this point
Never said that he didn't. I was just comparing them as young players. Faried's problem is that he 's barely improved since his early seasons. Collins probably will. But as high-energy rebounders, excellent finishers at the rim, extremely athletic players which allows them to cover up their defensive IQ limitations, I think the comparison is very apt.
EZ wins EZ lyfe
good win for the tank
Bud always brings along rookies slowly. I have faith with his player development. Once Collins gets settled in around mid season, and JC puts on like 10 more pounds of muscle he's gonna be an absolute force.  He's looked so awesome 
Im stoked for the young core. Collins, Prince and Dennis is a great start. Even Bembry has crazy potential. 


Id love to see a couple of dads traded for picks. Charge Daddy and Daddy Dedeye could be nice cheap pieces for a contender.  
Just don't invest emotionally in winning this year man.  We will be better off in the long run for this. 
Ooo that first one looks NICE. How about:

Dennis- Bembry - Prince - Porter - Collins

Then another top pick next year probably then maybe we can build a core good enough to lure the one that got away here. I'm talking Greek Freak!
KP would be much more likely imo, who also got away from us. 
No way we could pay that team lol. Also AD
Looks 2gud2b tru.

No way the Suns do that though.

But if it did happen, it'd be pretty cool to see Bledsoe and Schroder coexist together in the backcourt. Bringing Bender in would likely spark trade rumors revolving around Ilyasova, who hasn't had a very good year so far.
it says right there that it decreases our predicted win total by 2...
Wish we still had Dwight so that when Dragan has a good game, Dwight could say our D was good tonight in the postgame.
Our win percentage falls by 2 if we make the trade. Therefore helping the tank 
That would have been completely and utterly embarrassing. I don’t know how you could have come back from that. It’s a good call that you didn’t do it lmao. 
Bud wont start him. He might cause us to win games and ruin the cawcess 
John Collins has been looking good so far
It’s amazing how better we are with Collins on the court
lol at Bud keeping our best player off the court for the final ten minutes. Totally not tanking! 
What exactly does Delaney do well?
Lol you guys just wait till we get plumlee before making judgments on us 
Collins and Prince both looked great. Lots of positives. Still unbeaten too! 
Our three best players are 24, 22, and 20. Add a top 5 pick and we have one of the best young cores in the nba. 
TFW- you are a great coach with a team of bench players 
That rim hang was sweet, though
Yeah, I think he's going to turn out to be something special
Try telling me he's not our best player. I like a good joke
Sometimes your team is too good and is ruining chances of good draft picks so you gotta throw a wrench in there
Baze and Dennis I'm pretty sure
lol he means 24 years old :)
###I LOVE BASKETBALL
Isn't J-Smoove a free agent??? 🤔🤔🤔
Dennis rolling his ankle so he wont have to play to give us a better chance at losing....4D chess...
Would love to see Bud get on the court and run point tbh
well the german national team won the world cup like that so it looks good
Baby Bud is cool as well but he doesn't have the constant look of disbelief and disgust on his face that make Bud so great.
He should take his time, we have a talent loaded roster so we need to make sure he's in good shape for the playoffs instead.
When we needed him most, Jose Calderon signed somewhere else.


A hundred years passed and Travis Schlenk discovered the new GOAT, an big man named John Collins, and although his dunking skills are great, he still has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.

But I believe John the Baptist can save the world.
Is he healthy?
We need to build our team to the point that Baze is our 6th man. He's ideal for that role instead of as a starter. 
Never. Baze is a great tank commander
Thing is he played his best season with us as the first guy off the bench. He can provide a lot of energy for a secondary unit while the starters are resting.
in only 21 minutes.  is it too early to say hes the best forward in the NBA?
Can't he best at both?
He's the best PG in the league, you just haven't seen his real shit yet
I'm just glad Brooklyn honored the non-aggression pact and we got out of there without any injuries
Officially tied with Golden State
Really dug seeing the Hawks play in person this year so early on in the season. 

Saw around 40+ Hawks fans in gear throughout the afternoon at Barclays. 

Loved that Bazemore foul right before the half. The Hawks are amazing at free throws this season!



Anybody watching at home notice some game clock mishaps?
That looked like a normal ankle sprain. I think he'll be fine. Maybe miss a couple of weeks
He looked like he rolled/sprained it. He’ll get better
a non-serious injury that takes him out of commission seems like one of the best case scenarios-- young players get more burn, hawks lose more games, and it doesn't affect next season's play. Now we just need Bembry to come back...
Dedmon is only 28, the first of many Schlenk Steals™
Sweet Prince seems like he's made a step forward this season. He's a versatile wing.
Bazeless did something good. Who knew?
I love the lineup we have out right now

Dennis

Bellineli

Prince

JC

Illy
Man...we're trying our best to keep our amnesty contract intact and allow Dennis to score 26 pts but he's making it mighty difficult
Atlanta Hawks taking notes from New York Giants. I knew I picked the right NBA team.
There’s a serious lack of ball movement. It was great in Dallas idk what happened
I think its safe to say whoever wins this wins the championship

I fucking love your sub guys.
The NBA is rigged. Can’t take this any more man, we gotta fire Goodell
Hawks had me worried that they would be a good team this year. Tanking is back on the menu boys 🙌

lmao 😂😂😂 i just heard the funniest joke 😂😂😂 someone told me 😂😂😂 that the hawks are tanking 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Kaminsiky literally gets to the post and gets fouled with his best skill, white privilege
Andre seems cool, but he's no Olivia 😭😭😭
I love the Hawks but I may switch teams based solely on the Rooms-to-go Kids “My Stuff” commercial
Hawks just did their best impression of the Super Bowl.
Im in love with a Baptist. 
deadman hitting 3's lmao
They wanted to appropriate our cultural memes so we're gonna appropriate their winning season
I watched Dedmon at USC dude couldn't even hit a 2 foot shot two years under Pop and Bud and this dude is Steph Curry but better
Dwight getting payback w the elbows lol
our energy is through the roof right now. We're showing that chip on our shoulder
Kemba is so confident right now. 
When we win we win. But when we lose we also win 
[Dwight Howard trying to fit in with a new team ](http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/sites/default/files/cancer-cells-growing.jpg) 
Hahaha I love it
If we can get rid of Baze this season then it's a success no matter what happens
Collins lookin real lost already lol
Maybe or bud is a legit top 3 coach
Summed it up perfectly
Wasn’t bud the manager of basketball operations before this season? He was picking the players on the roster more before we got schlenk 
I could've sworn he played more than it's listed on the ESPN app
Good*
There are people who think baby Bud Snyder and Stevens were better. They can succ me
He's top 3 for sure, he's in the Pop/Carlisle tier IMO
This should be a place where we are friends, not where I would stab you if you were in front of me right now.
R/NBA might have him top 10 lol they crazy over BBB over there though
;)
Great, I was looking for something to counteract my autism when it spikes up
So do we still get a top pick if we forfeit the rest of the season?
Pierre out, but Bembry still available 
right? he like 50% of the reason i'm excited to watch this team
>“Off the court he is a good guy,” Schroder said. “He did a great job trying to bring everybody together, as always. On the court we are too different. That’s on the court. But off the court, I think (he’s) amazing.”

>How are he and Howard different?

>“Personalities,” Schroder said. “I’m a little different than everybody, I think. I always just try to do everything I can to win the game. I’m too competitive, sometimes.”

So basically Schroder agrees with Kobe

Yup, like Olaf said, the nets have nothing to give us, unless they are willing to give up dlo, which they aren't. But crazier things have happened this offseason, so I guess you never know
And to watch everyone else lose so you feel better for the falcons loss 
I can't wait to see Dwight on the other team. I still love the guy and want him to do well, but it feels a lot better knowing that we don't have to cater our offense to fit him in.  
Top 10 Anime Betrayals
Do we want to win or not I'm so conflicted
Damn I think we win this one, Dennis is just as good as Kemba and we honestly have more talent otherwise 
he's still injured lol

Even though I feel without him the games will be infinitely more watchable and fun but I'm still gonna miss him as a personality.
Probably for the best, the energy he radiates from the bench will be more than enough to inspire us to a victory
hmmm TIL :D
We don’t need this whole team to go undefeated. May as well collect more assets. 
He was just a system dad

^^^^^just ^^^^^kidding ^^^^^love ^^^^^you ^^^^^timmay
Am I supposed to like this? I can't. Love Tim. I want him to be very successful!
Everyone is a system dad when you have a great system.
Yeah, not cuz we're tanking either, I just genuinely want the Knicks to have a better record than us
Why?  I hope he shoots the ball everytime he touches it.  Don't you want a top 5 pick?
True.  But what if he ends up being like pretty good and we end up getting the 14th pick?  Its hard to be mad about Collins being really good but at the same time, if you let Baze shoot then we know for a fact that we are getting a top 5 pick (probably top 3).
I don't know. I think its too early to say.  I'd like to see how some of the top guys do in college first but there is a lot of good talent in the top 5.  Doncic, Porter, Bagley, Bamba, Ayton.  Lots of bigs and then Doncic.
Y'all need to get off this. The entire eastern conference is tanking and there's no way we're getting a top 5 pick. 
I've been on this sub for years and read all the memes and shit posts. This may single handedly be the dumbest shit I've read on here lol good job
That’s it. Call in the dogs. You win
The golden onion right here
Considering you're on this sub, sure ;)
Hold on, out rn, I'll link when I get home. If I can even find it lol 
u ok
His midrange jumper was always a concern. It looks good so far this season. He has a real shot at being an All-Star.
What? That was his greatest strength last season. His 3pt shot is the concern
98-0 isn't out of the question either to be honest
Exactly fam, so let me dream while I can 🤔
Aww his surrogate family is so cute
But for real, Bud is fairly young for a coach so he'll probably have at least a good 15-20 more years in him, at some point he'll get an actually talented roster to work with (hopefully in Atlanta) which really could give him a HOF coaching career. 
I didn't watch any preseason. This kid is FAST. I didn't realize how quick he was until you see him dance around everyone in the paint. GOD DAMN is that good to see. Also, he may have that mid-range jumper that snek had hiding in there somewhere.
Noel is one of the best defensive centers too. Futures bright
also more than IT. Dennis gon be an all-star confirmed
Just like Markelle Fultz’s free throws
Yeah, you right.

I'm not saying that we're the best team in the NBA but we're certainly better than about 29 other teams.
Marco Belinelli is the greatest pure shooter of all time dont @ me
We can't even tank right lol 
actually we're good
Shröder was UNSTOPPABLE tonight! That was fun to watch. 
Great team win, Dennis is daddy, but fuck man do I really wish we still had THJ.
The Baptist remains perfect and avoids a sinful loss. Our savior is with us
With all the injuries going around in the NBA, I'm glad we're in good hands with Sharecare. 82-0, here we come!
I love my team :')
I have the best game thread idea now
First place Hawks
Good win boys!!! Let's bring it to the Hornets Friday 
Not gonna lie, I liked the set where Belly was running the point with him and Delaney in the backcourt. 
I LOVE THE FACT THAT DEDMON CAN HIT FREETHROWS AT A 70% RATE!
Winning is better than losing 
Nice. Peaking at just the right part of the season. 
Wow, that was the best NBA finals I've ever seen.
Fly it to the winning streak, baby! 
We dont have to tank from the start, compete against some teams and show we have good hustle.. let shrod, collins, prince and bembry ball.. go on some long ass losing streaks and trade ilysova and beli/baze for more picks in the new yr. 

Thats my dream scenario that doesn't involve a championship.
Back at the top of the Eastern Conference
I love this sub so fucking much
Praise be our Sharecare employees brought great honor to Sharecare today
we welcome you 
You picked the best NBA team based on Subreddit to join.  Welcome. 
Lol, said this right after we won. Goddammit.
We showcased him well, and in return, we know that we got him millions upon millions and he will be able to care for multiple generations of family. We changed his life for the better beyond imagination.
🎶🎵🎶  EVERYTHING IS AWESOME 🎶🎵🎶
Hey thanks for being so welcoming. 

Honestly I’ve had a bunch of fun browsing this subreddit and figuring out what all the jokes are and how people actually feel about the team. 
We have all these great dads, but there's always going to be one missing😥
Th3 and th4 better thank us
Perfect

Now succ me
There are no jokes on this sub. We’re the best team in the NBA
SEXY
hell yea then, wasn’t too sure about how it worked this year 
Damn right 
I love Paul and will never boo him! I WILL boo SNEK 🐍 for the rest of my life though 
I can't see Millsap being booed. He is way too beloved.
I really don't think that he will be but I'm of the camp that wasn't expecting Horford to get boo'ed. Obviously Horford wanted to leave when we were trying to keep him so it's different but he was still a huge part of some great years. 
He just went to get cigarettes, it's ok.
This happened in the pre-season as well and I'm genuinely really interested to find out why
Wait so is it a swish or a swosh? I honestly thought it was just a check mark
I wonder how playing against the greatest German player ever is gonna impact Dirk
LOL collins just tried to end dirk's life
1 touch 3 points. Perfect efficiency for JTB.
#ROTY
Edit: it has come to my attention that this isn’t a question. 8 pts in 1 quarter? That’s 32 pts a game. 
I think it speaks to how good Collins is that Bud is gonna give him a lot of minutes early on and Bud hates rookies
John Collins looks like a rich man's Anthony Davis while the top pick in the draft is doing this rn:

SCHRODER = MVP confirmed
So we are going to win 11 straight champion ships as evidence by the 11 straight points 
I was okay with going 0-82 but now I'm okay with going 82-0
In light of the genuine enthusiasm from Magette's parents and the roundabout connection of my dad having gone to the same university he is now my favorite player
I love that Nique calls Nerlens "New Orleans"
beli went full hero. never go full hero
Ok I have my headphones on too so I may have misunderstood, but did Nique just call Nerlens New Orleans?
We can't even tank properly lol
Lol is Magette on our team cause he looks like Bud?
lol at Dennis's interview. It was basically "I play better because coach tell me to"
There may not be a lot of talent on this team but we've got some scrappers for sure 
1 of 81 more wins
TANKING IS  FUN
I DON'T KNOW IF I SHOULD BE HAPPY OR SAD SOMEONE TELL ME WHAT TO FEEL

BUT I LOVE THIS TEAM MOTHERFUCKERSSSSSSSSSSS
Nique just called Nerlens Noel "New Orleans". I love this season
Hawks deliberately play games close to give Emory Healthcare more business stay woke
I know it's early but I really think people are underestimating Bud. We are both lucky and fucked to have one of the best coaches. We will constantly be just good enough for playoffs an constantly be too good for a high pick 
Hearing Bob try to sell us on rappers he likely knows nothing about is great
God im so glad Atlanta was the team to finally build a team BETTER than the Warriors.
ARE WE TANKING OR ARE WE NOT WTF WERE WE SUPPOSED TO WIN
I see our 3 point D is still in full form 
Lol this man has 8 in his first quarter 
Only way Dennis doesn't win MVP is if Collins keeps improving 
We tanking too good now 😫😫😫
When Schröder is doing interviews and he is out of breath, he sounds like he has peanut butter on the roof of his mouth. I know it's just his accent but I can't help but laugh sometimes.
need to see more of that 

Magette/Beli/Bembry/Collins lineup. was pretty fun to watch
Really happy with Dennis so far. 2 biggest areas of concern are 1. a couple missed layups and 2. we are playing a Dennis Smith Jr. which confuses me, and I'm not sure how many more of these Dennis match ups I can take. 
Pretty sure Nique just called Nerlens “New Orleans”
Lmao Dedmon lifted Schroder up and walked away while Schroder was in pain 
We currently have more wins this year than Golden State.
Trade Bellineli/Babbitt/Dedmon, we're too good. We need to tank.
Prince and Shroeder are literally better than Curry and Durant
Let's remain competitive while retooling better than the Braves did shall we?
It feels so good to watch Hawks basketball again
I love John Collins so much 
This might be an unpopular opinion but John Collins is sort of good
Ok so I don't pay too much attention to shit outside of our Hawks, so are the Mavs supposed to be good? Like is this holy shit how is a retooling team winning? Or is it well yeah the Mavs suck, or just an 82-0 team steamrolling its first opponent?
Harrison Barnes in full NBA finals form already
PEOPLE I LOVE:

DENNIS SCHRODER
JOHN COLLINS
TUAREAN PRINCE
DEANDRE BEMBRY
Jerome Jurenovich is the best name ever.

I wouldn't be surprised if Belinelli took a Korver role and plays the best basketball of his career under Bud
I did not expect Belli to look anywhere near this good. I hope he keeps this up. 
Belli is awesome.
Love Bembry's defense.
welcome to the 2017-18 season mr bazemore
Lmao that shot by Belinelli. 
Tanks for the win, Mark Cuban
Welcome back, daddies
That feeling when you want to watch the hawks continue their winning streak but your also a dodgers fan. Such a dilemma.
Someone gif that John Collins nod when he was shooting free throws
Rathbun hates DSJ lmao
This mavs run is less than ideal for our season of #nottank
fuck dallas for being straight garbage 

but i aint goona lie feels good to be winning
Bembry might have the most BBIQ on the team
dedmon LOL
About time Baze... still love ya, but...
went to sweetwater, got the free pint glass, saw harry the hawk. we're gonn win and get that 8 seed. comfy as hell
Schroder is just simply too fast for most defenders. 
Mark Cuban cannot believe what is happening right now
Cuban did not look happy.
We have 42.8% more points!

This team is amazing!
Lol Mavs are so petty benching Noel for not wanting to be underpaid 
Dennis is going to win MIP, calling it now
We're playing so many players b/c they can't all suck at the same time.
Feeling pretty good yall
Honestly I like DSJ but there better not be any confusion about who the best Dennis in the league is
How’s Magette playing? I play pickup with him from where I live? I’m a Celtics fan but I wouldn’t mind him giving us 30. He’s a great guy
Just to feel the consensus who is everyone's favorite dad? I like Daddy Prince the best.  
Lol Illy with the biggest flop
Illy so good at getting knocked down I bet Leo could do it 
Illyasova not doing a very good job of rotating on defense.
dedmon is a walking foul-turnover machine lmao 
I can just watch us play and not give a shit about the result, it's amazing
I'm right there with you.
Couldn't agree more. With our roster it will be interesting to see Collins, Bembry, Prince, Delaney improve and I think on nights where our shots are falling it will be nice and when our offense crumbles I can sit back and focus on the re-tool.
LOL goddamn i want barnes to play well but tonight that was NOT IT
i mean, not saying I disagree, but who else are we gonna play really lol
Honest question... Is he mixed or albino? 
When I first saw him I just thought it was one of buds kids
Hey that's pretty good
His defense is pretty awesome
Helps when you have a head coach with a good system. Shot selection was fantastic.
Hopefully this season will let Bud get the respect he deserves as being a top 3, top 4 coach in the NBA
LOL
I am ok with this
im so torn. i honestly thought i was ready to take L's. just feels soooooo damn good getting a win
and ballin' belly has like 20 lmao
Better than Golden State confirmed.
They'd make the playoffs in the East, but in the West they're a 35-40 win team
Well, to be fair, the mavs had the 9*th overall pick last draft. 

We're also not tanking so that also answers the rest of your questions
Me too that shot is crisp. 
I'm watching FSgo with the good crew. God damn I love our announcers 
Mother's will love it so it works.
I live in Dallas. Texans love anything Texas. 
Ersan for Giannis confirmed
well... we should actually this year :)
Hilarious 😂
um he has 11 on like 50% shooting tf more do you want

edit 14 on 50%
LOL 
Honestly, they make me too comfortable. 
I love it. Kobe Schroder.
It's tough because I want us to win every night but I also want that lottery pick..
yeah add curry & KD and we've got a real team on our hands!
FRESH SQUEEEZEDDDD
Illy or Moose or Prince at the 4. Idk there's options for sure. I definitely think Collins is the best choice but Bud has a tendency to sit rookies for close to a season so they learn the system 
I am too mainly because it's not like there's anyone else better on our team. 
Good bot
Great bot 
you hear what you want to hear ;)
So happy for him man. He goes to my gym and we played pickup ball this summer before the summer league. Genuinely nicest guy I’ve ever met.
Dad is a great Dad
Yea but every available player has played its surprising even for the first game i like it tho their all giving the best and if they keep that up all our predictions will be right 82-0
Our dad, is an awesome dad he reigns, from Piedmont to Peachtree, he reigns. 
My favorite Pierre with the Twists in his Hair Bear
God I love this sub and all of you.
I don't like the first paragraph, Bazemore was on the 60 win Hawks too. Everything else is good though.
So many new dads out to compete for our love
I moved to Dallas 3 years ago and tonight will be the first time I'll see my beloved cicadas play in person since 2013. I'll be pregaming with some Sweet Water and hope that the 82-0 dream stays alive.  
Glad to be back boys
happy opening night folk! havn't been here in a while...so you guys finally got rid of thrash? and if so...congrats!

Do you host a news show or are you just a naturally gifted young man 
baze points and hawks turnovers will be the same number. 18. yeah, i went out on a limb, b/c that is what hawks do. and fly. 18. 
Given that our bench came back from a 26 point lead against a fully healthy Cavs team then the night after blew out that same Cavs team you're probably better off with him on he bench
He's a solid player who might turn into a decent 6th man in 8 years like Lou Williams. Delaney is better than him rn imo so not too concerned. 
To beat the best, you must get inside the mind of the best. That's 100% GSW strategy here.
True! My thoughts are that's exactly Atlanta's strategy. Basically Cooks a spy.
Hawks are birds, therefore all ex hawks are his little birds. That's why we have an old player on every good team in the east 
Nah, we lost way too many key players.  Mo Williams, Jamal Crawford, Richard Jefferson, Diamond Stone.  You don't let that many star players leave unless you're tanking.
Dallas is projected to score -6.0 points. That’s just how good our defense is.
his dunks are worth 2.5 because of style points
